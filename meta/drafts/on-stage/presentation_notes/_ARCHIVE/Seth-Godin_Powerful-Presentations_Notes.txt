the presenter has power, control of timing
goals:
cause change
have a point of view
know that change you want
who are you trying to change
should I send a memo instead?
be specific
what do they believe?
enrollment: if I can do this, are you able to that
narrative: create tention through emotions, history, drama
follow up: how to relieve tension --> call to action (foreshadow this)
exhibits, assertions, proof, trust
highlights, separate support; highlights are just the essence of your idea
treat each slide as your best chance to influence
spaghetti wants to show, 'I did my homework', 'I told you it's a mess', I didn't bother to break this down, weird stuff
how to persuade: if...then...else
Marshalla Gans
self us now
why are you here; who/commitment; why is it urgent
outline slides: one idea per index card
best slides prompt stories
bullets are chances for stories
slides are free
one idea per slide
presenter view: start talking about next slide before it comes up
don't read slides: use both sides of audience's brain
find a good font
don't use stock photos
bring other voices on through videos, clients)
have an exhibit to leave behind
people respond to your emotion
don't let the defaults of the tool determine what you do
