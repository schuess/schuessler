    "post_content": "Last night was my leaving do\/going away party in Shoreditch, and today was my last day at work.  I came in just to say goodbye and give back my ID card and BlackBerry.  After two years of being on call, I wasn't sorry to give up the BlackBerry, but after more than seven years at the company, it was a little sad to ask the guard to open the gate and let me out.\r\n\r\nAndy and Mechelle took me to lunch with them at the Walrus and Carpenter.  I ordered steak and ale pie in short pastry and mentioned that when I moved to London, I imagined I would be eating like this all the time.  Andy said don't stereotype the English.  I said if I were stereotyping, I would have ordered a curry, a lager, and a punch-up.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch I walked back to The Light to pick up my credit card and pay my tab from the night before (I forgot this when we wobbled out to the second venue).\r\n\r\nNext I went to the post office and mailed my passport to the US Embassy here in London to get it renewed (that takes some faith!).  I had added some new pages two years ago, but on my trip to Ireland last month, the immigration officer used up the (entire) last clean page.  The website says it will take 15 days, so (fingers crossed) I will have it back before my flight leaves on September 1.\r\n\r\nWhen I got home, I disabled the script that plays music to wake me up in the morning -- I still don't quite believe it, but I won't need to get up regularly at any certain time for the next year at least.",

    "post_content": "Last night was my leaving do\/going away party in Shoreditch, and today was my last day at work.  I came in just to say goodbye and give back my ID card and blackberry (my badge and gun).  After two years of being on call, I wasn't sorry to give up the blackberry, but after more than seven years at the company, it was a little sad to ask the guard to open the gate and let me out.\r\n\r\nI had lunch with Andy and Mechelle at the Walrus and Carpenter:  steak and ale pie in short pastry.  I said that when I moved to England, I imagined I would be eating like this all the time.  Andy said don't stereotype the English.  I said if I were stereotyping, I would have ordered a curry, a lager, and a punch-up.  He had a version of toad-in-the-hole, which I was glad to see an example of finally.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch I walked back to The Light to pick up my credit card and pay my tab from the night before (I forgot this when we wobbled out to the second venue).\r\n\r\nNext I went to the post office and mailed my passport to the US Embassy here in London to get it renewed (that takes some faith!).  I had added some new pages two years ago, but on my trip to Ireland last month, the immigration officer used up the (entire) last clean page.

    "post_content": "As part of the wealth reduction plan I began by quitting my job, I spent the day giving things away:  A futon from Isetan Tokyo; a magnetic whiteboard I had custom-made according to the golden ratio; a new leather Tumi computer briefcase; five large bookcases; cookbooks, a double boiler, an ice cream scoop, and other kitchen equipment; several \"50 best\" editions of Time Out I had collected (best websites, best breakfasts, best pubs and clubs, etc.).  I decided to get rid of anything I could easily replace.\r\n\r\n<em>Homo economicus<\/em> would reason that it's cheaper to replace commodity items than to ship and store them.  But the main motivation was irrational:  I've had some of this stuff since university, and much of it since I moved to Tokyo over eight years ago.  I believe (am hoping) that after this time off I'll have a different perspective on the world, and perhaps even different ideals and goals.  Do I want to come back to the same furniture?\r\n\r\nI may have less cruft than some people since I've moved long distances often and have had correspondingly many opportunities to purge my possessions.  But most of those moves were made quickly, and I never considered giving away items that still had substantial utility.  Now that I have a few weeks to go through everything carefully, I'm testing things not according to their usefulness, but their replaceability.\r\n\r\nWhy give things away?  I was not really tempted to sell my stuff on eBay largely because I don't want to spend the last two weeks here taking and uploading photos and arranging to meet sometimes flaky potential buyers.  But I <strong>am<\/strong> tempted to haul everything down to Brick Lane or Old Bethnal Green Road where my neighbors sell each other stolen bikes, used combs, half-complete Hogwarts Express train sets, and other inconsequential things from blankets on the sidewalk.  The pre-internet eBay.  I probably don't really want to spend a day doing that either, though, so giving things away is a good option.  My friends (or the local charity shops) benefit, and it turns out that I benefit too:  Manny traded me a new backpack just the right size (and color!) for my trip.",

That's what the Thailand trip cost per year. I also read in a travel article on \"gap years\" that the average student year off costs just under $10,000. The maximum of $36,000 was for the Africa trip (the shortest one!), but that was someone who wanted to get the most out of his relatively limited travel time (and was well beyond living as a student).<\/div>\nPeople have very vague memories of what their trips cost, even though that's the subject that other people planning such a trip are most keenly interested in. When I move to a new country, I try to write down every expense for the first six months I am there to teach my subconscious how to estimate cash flow in the new location. I've decided to do the same thing for this trip, and my spreadsheet tells me that I've managed to break the minimum budget before even leaving my apartment, as follows:\n<div>\n<ol>\n\t<li>One around-the-world ticket with nine stops: $4,065 (a good deal, I thought).<\/li>\n\t<li>Relocation expenses to ship my stuff to the US: $3,370 (estimated -- might be more or less, but I won't know until Monday).<\/li>\n\t<li>Passport renewal fee, postage, etc.: $152<\/li>\n\t<li>New camera: $560 (ridiculously overpriced because I bought it (a) in the UK, and (b) on the high street)<\/li>\n\t<li>Health insurance (one year in advance): $3,675 (not too high, but not a fun thing to have to pay for)<\/li>\n\t<li>Private Chinese lessons at SOAS: $1,155<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div>I'm not sure I really <strong>had<\/strong> to buy any of those things except the passport renewal and maybe the health insurance. I don't expect to have any further large expenses, so have segregated these \"preliminary\" expenses.<\/div>\nIn the interest of science, I've also netted my assets and liabilities to arrive at a net worth figure, <em>x<\/em>. At the end of the year, I'll recalculate it, and be able to give an exact accounting (in the literal sense) of my time off.\n\n<\/div>",

That's what the Thailand trip cost per year.  I also read in a travel article on \"gap years\" that the average student year off costs just under $10,000.  The maximum of $36,000 was for the Africa trip (the shortest one!), but that was someone who wanted to get the most out of his relatively limited travel time (and was well beyond living as a student).<\/div>\r\nPeople have very vague memories of what their trips cost, even though that's the subject that other people planning such a trip are most keenly interested in.  When I move to a new country, I try to write down every expense for the first six months I am there to teach my subconscious how to estimate cash flow in the new location.  I've decided to do the same thing for this trip, and my spreadsheet tells me that I've managed to break the minimum budget before even leaving my apartment, as follows:\r\n<div>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>One around-the-world ticket with nine stops:  $4,065 (a good deal, I thought).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Relocation expenses to ship my stuff to the US:  $3,370 (estimated -- might be more or less, but I won't know until Monday).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Passport renewal fee, postage, etc.:  $152<\/li>\r\n\t<li>New camera:  $560 (ridiculously overpriced because I bought it (a) in the UK, and (b) on the high street)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Health insurance (one year in advance):  $3,675 (not too high, but not a fun thing to have to pay for)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Private Chinese lessons at SOAS:  $1,155<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<div>I'm not sure I really <strong>had<\/strong> to buy any of those things except the passport renewal and maybe the health insurance.  I don't expect to have any further large expenses, so have segregated these \"preliminary\" expenses.<\/div>\r\nIn the interest of science, I've also netted my assets and liabilities to arrive at a net worth figure, <em>x<\/em>.  At the end of the year, I'll recalculate it, and be able to give an exact accounting (in the literal sense) of my time off.<\/div>",

I came in just to say goodbye and give back my ID card and blackberry (my badge and gun).  After two years of being on call, I wasn't sorry to give up the blackberry, but after more than seven years at the company, it was a little sad to ask the guard to open the gate and let me out.\r\n\r\nAndy and Mechelle took me to lunch with them at the Walrus and Carpenter.  I ordered steak and ale pie in short pastry and mentioned that when I moved to London, I imagined I would be eating like this all the time.  Andy said don't stereotype the English.  I said if I were stereotyping, I would have ordered a curry, a lager, and a punch-up.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch I walked back to The Light to pick up my credit card and pay my tab from the night before (I forgot this when we wobbled out to the second venue).\r\n\r\nNext I went to the post office and mailed my passport to the US Embassy here in London to get it renewed (that takes some faith!).  I had added some new pages two years ago, but on my trip to Ireland last month, the immigration officer used up the (entire) last clean page.  The website says it will take 15 days, so (fingers crossed) I will have it back before my flight leaves on September 1.\r\n\r\nWhen I got home, I disabled the script that plays music to wake me up in the morning -- I still don't quite believe it, but I won't need to get up regularly at any certain time for the next year at least.",

I'm sure that's higher than average, even in this footloose age.  Luckily, I didn't have to start the reckoning from scratch.  I calculated several years ago that my family had moved 21 times before I turned 17, so I just added the moves from when I left for college (exactly double).\r\n\r\nWhen you move internationally, you fill out reams of forms:  volume estimates, insurance forms, customs forms, powers-of-attorney, and shipping inventories.  All of these forms ask for basically the same information (what you are shipping, what it's worth, where it's going), and each time you move, you start from scratch, even if you are moving basically the same stuff (i.e., you haven't acquired or discarded much).  This sounds like an opportunity for automation!\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Tokyo (two moves before the current one), I bought 28 clear plastic boxes with locking lids and printed out 28 A4 pages with the following information:\r\n<blockquote>Property of Shanghai Bob (bobby.dazzler@shanghaibob.com)\r\nFull contents online at http:\/\/shanghaibob.com\/contents\/\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 90px;\">1<\/h1>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Box 1 of 28<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\nThen I put the pages into plastic slip-covers (more plastic!) underneath the box lids.  The main numbers are one-third the height of the page, easy to see without opening the box.\r\n\r\nI use the numbers as IDs (primary keys) for an online inventory.  Some of the boxes I don't even open from move to move (old photos, archived files, etc.), so I don't have to re-do any of that work.  And if I move the contents of a smaller box to a larger one or vice versa, I just swap the ID pages and repoint the online content listing.  When the movers come, I print out a copy for them and myself, and we use the same file for insurance.\r\n\r\nWhen I store my stuff, I just store the boxes in numerical order.  If I need something, I look the location up on my website.  When I was in the US and my stuff was in storage in the UK, I needed my tux (dinner jacket) for the Christmas party.  I looked online and saw that it was in box 13 -- if only it had been as easy for my UK-based friend to ship it through customs as it was to identify the correct box.\r\n\r\nNormally primary\/surrogate keys don't convey any information, but I took advantage of a few mnemonics:  I put Christmas ornaments in box 25, my old (paper-based!) journals in 17 (my birthday), and my go set (a Japanese board game) in box five (the Japanese word for five is pronounced \"go\").",

But the main motivation was irrational:  I've had some of this stuff since university, and much of it since I moved to Tokyo over eight years ago.  I believe (am hoping) that after this time off I'll have a different perspective on the world, and perhaps even different ideals and goals.  Do I want to come back to the same furniture?\r\n\r\nI may have less cruft than some people since I've moved long distances often and have had correspondingly many opportunities to purge my possessions.  But most of those moves were made quickly, and I never considered giving away items that still had substantial utility.  Now that I have a few weeks to go through everything carefully, I'm testing things not according to their usefulness, but their replaceability.\r\n\r\nWhy give things away?  I was not really tempted to sell my stuff on eBay largely because I don't want to spend the last two weeks here taking and uploading photos and arranging to meet sometimes flaky potential buyers.  But I <strong>am<\/strong> tempted to haul everything down to Brick Lane or Old Bethnal Green Road where my neighbors sell each other stolen bikes, used combs, half-complete Hogwarts Express train sets, and other inconsequential things from blankets on the sidewalk.  The pre-internet eBay.  I probably don't really want to spend a day doing that either, though, so giving things away is a good option.  My friends (or the local charity shops) benefit, and it turns out that I benefit too:  Manny gave me a new backpack just the right size (and color!) for my trip.",

That's what the Thailand trip cost per year.  I also read in a travel article on \"gap years\" that the average student year off costs just under $10,000.  The maximum of $36,000 was for the Africa trip (the shortest one!), but that was someone who wanted to get the most out of his relatively limited travel time (and was well beyond living as a student).<\/div>\r\nPeople have very vague memories of what their trips cost, even though that's the subject that other people planning such a trip are most keenly interested in.  When I move to a new country, I try to write down every expense for the first six months I am there to teach my subconscious how to estimate cash flow in the new location.  I've decided to do the same thing for this trip, and my spreadsheet tells me that I've managed to break the minimum budget before even leaving my apartment, as follows:\r\n<div>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>One around-the-world ticket with nine stops:  $4,065 (a good deal, I thought).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Relocation expenses to ship my stuff to the US:  $3,370 (estimated -- might be more or less, but I won't know until Monday).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Passport renewal fee, postage, etc.:  $152<\/li>\r\n\t<li>New camera:  $560 (ridiculously overpriced because I bought it (a) in the UK, and (b) on the high street)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Health insurance (one year in advance):  $3,675 (not too high, but not a fun thing to have to pay for)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Private Chinese lessons at SOAS:  $1,155<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<div>I'm not sure I really <strong>had<\/strong> to buy any of those things except the passport renewal and maybe the health insurance.  I don't expect to have any further large expenses, so have segregated these \"preliminary\" expenses.<\/div>\r\nIn the interest of science, I've also netted my assets and liabilities to arrive at a net worth figure, <em>x<\/em>.  At the end of the year, I'll recalculate it, and be able to give an exact accounting (in the literal sense) of my time off.<\/div>",

    "post_content": "I have friends who have taken the following long trips:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Three years in Thailand<\/li>\r\n\t<li>One year traveling in South America<\/li>\r\n\t<li>One year surfing in Costa Rica<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Seven months in Africa<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<div>The minimum for a year off seems to be $10,000.  That's what the Thailand trip cost per year.  I also read in a travel article on \"gap years\" that the average student year off costs just under $10,000.  The maximum of $36,000 was for the Africa trip (the shortest one!), but that was someone who wanted to get the most out of his relatively limited travel time (and was well beyond living as a student).<\/div>\r\nPeople have very vague memories of what their trips cost, even though that's the subject that other people planning such a trip are most keenly interested in.  When I move to a new country, I try to write down every expense for the first six months I am there to teach my subconscious how much it costs to live in the new location.  I've decided to do the same thing for this trip, and my spreadsheet tells me that I've managed to break the minimum budget before even leaving my apartment, as follows:\r\n<div>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>One around-the-world ticket with nine stops:  $4,065 (a good deal, I thought).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Relocation expenses to ship my stuff to the US:  $3,370 (estimated -- might be more or less, but I won't know until Monday).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Passport renewal fee, postage, etc.:  $152<\/li>\r\n\t<li>New camera:  $560 (ridiculously overpriced because I bought it (a) in the UK, and (b) on the high street)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Health insurance (one year in advance):  $3,675 (not too high, but not a fun thing to have to pay for)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Private Chinese lessons at SOAS:  $1,155<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<div>I'm not sure I really <strong>had<\/strong> to buy any of those things except the passport renewal and maybe the health insurance.  I don't expect to have any further large expenses, so have segregated these \"preliminary\" expenses.<\/div>\r\nIn the interest of science, I've also netted my assets and liabilities to arrive at a net worth figure, <em>x<\/em>.  At the end of the year, I'll recalculate it, and be able to give an exact accounting (in the literal sense) of my time off.<\/div>",

It is strange, however, that someone looking at bright blue cufflinks would think that they <em>looked<\/em> like the green light of a stoplight.

    "post_content": "It to me a while to calculate this, but I figured out that this is my ninth international move and my 42nd move overall.  I'm sure that's higher than average, even in this footloose age.  Luckily, I didn't have to start the reckoning from scratch.  I calculated several years ago that my family had moved 21 times before I turned 17, so I just added the moves from when I left for college (exactly double).\r\n\r\nWhen you move internationally, you fill out reams of forms:  volume estimates, insurance forms, customs forms, powers-of-attorney, and shipping inventories.  All of these forms ask for basically the same information (what you are shipping, what it's worth, where it's going), and each time you move, you start from scratch, even if you are moving basically the same stuff (i.e., you haven't acquired or discarded much).  This sounds like an opportunity for automation!\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Tokyo (two moves before the current one), I bought 28 clear plastic boxes with locking lids and printed out 28 A4 pages with the following information:\r\n<blockquote>Property of Shanghai Bob (itinerant@shanghaibob.com)\r\nFull contents online at http:\/\/shanghaibob.com\/contents\/\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 90px;\">1<\/h1>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Box 1 of 28<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\nThen I put the pages into plastic slip-covers (more plastic!) underneath the box lids.  The main numbers are one-third the height of the page, easy to see without opening the box.\r\n\r\nI use the numbers as IDs (primary keys) for an online inventory.  Some of the boxes I don't even open from move to move (old photos, archived files, etc.), so I don't have to re-do any of that work.  And if I move the contents of a smaller box to a larger one or vice versa, I just swap the ID pages and repoint the online content listing.  When the movers come, I print out a copy for them and myself, and we use the same file for insurance.\r\n\r\nWhen I store my stuff, I just store the boxes in numerical order.  If I need something, I look the location up on my website.  When I was in the US and my stuff was in storage in the UK, I needed my tux (dinner jacket) for the Christmas party.  I looked online and saw that it was in box 13 -- if only it had been as easy for my UK-based friend to ship it through customs as it was to identify the correct box.\r\n\r\nNormally primary\/surrogate keys don't convey any information, but I took advantage of a few mnemonics:  I put Christmas ornaments in box 25, my old (paper-based!) journals in 17 (my birthday), and my go set (a Japanese board game) in box five (the Japanese word for five is pronounced \"go\").",

    "post_content": "Today is grey and gloomy in London, with spattering rain.  Typical mid-summer weather!  Maybe because of the rain, but probably partly because I'm leaving soon, a poem I memorized at university was running through my head today.  The original is German, here's a translation:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h4>The Flying Robert<\/h4>\r\nEscapism, you cry out to me, \r\nreproachfully. \r\nWhat else, I reply, \r\nwith this lousy weather! \r\nI open my umbrella \r\nand launch myself into the winds. \r\nFrom your point of view \r\nI become smaller and smaller, \r\nuntil I vanish. \r\nI leave behind nothing \r\nbut a legend, \r\nwith which you green-eyed monsters \r\npester your children, \r\nwhen it storms outside, \r\nso that they do not fly away from you.\r\n\r\n  — Hans Magnus Enzensberger<\/blockquote>\r\n \r\n\"You green-eyed monsters\" is a loose translation of \"ihr Neidhammel\" (you envious people) in the original.  \"Hammel\" is <em>wether<\/em> in English, and if you grew up on a ranch you might recognize that word, but if not, you might think it's a typo for \"weather\" or \"whether\".  It means a castrated male sheep, the sheep-world equivalent of a steer.  That may seem like an obscure word, unless you recognize it as part of \"bellwether\", a word you've probably used.\r\n\r\nHere's the original:\r\n \r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h4>Der fliegende Robert<\/h4>\r\nEskapismus, ruft ihr mir zu, \r\nvorwurfsvoll. \r\nWas denn sonst, antworte ich, \r\nbei diesem Sauwetter! -, \r\nspanne den Regenschirm auf \r\nund erhebe mich in die Lüfte. \r\nVon euch aus gesehen, \r\nwerde ich immer kleiner und kleiner, \r\nbis ich verschwunden bin. \r\nIch hinterlasse nichts weiter \r\nals eine Legende, \r\nmit der ihr Neidhammel, \r\nwenn es draußen stürmt, \r\neuern Kindern in den Ohren liegt, \r\ndamit sie euch nicht davonfliegen.\r\n\r\n— Hans Magnus Enzensberger<\/blockquote>",

    "post_content": "Last night was my leaving do\/going away party in Shoreditch, and today was my last day at work.  I came in just to say goodbye and give back my ID card and blackberry (my badge and gun).  After two years of being on call, I wasn't sorry to give up the blackberry, but after more than seven years at the company, it was a little sad to ask the guard to open the gate and let me out.\r\n\r\nAndy and Mechelle took me to lunch with them at the Walrus and Carpenter.  I ordered steak and ale pie in short pastry and mentioned that when I moved to London, I imagined I would be eating like this all the time.  Andy said don't stereotype the English.  I said if I were stereotyping, I would have ordered a curry, a lager, and a punch-up.  He had a version of toad-in-the-hole, which I was glad to see an example of finally.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch I walked back to The Light to pick up my credit card and pay my tab from the night before (I forgot this when we wobbled out to the second venue).\r\n\r\nNext I went to the post office and mailed my passport to the US Embassy here in London to get it renewed (that takes some faith!).  I had added some new pages two years ago, but on my trip to Ireland last month, the immigration officer used up the (entire) last clean page.  The website says it will take 15 days, so (fingers crossed) I will have it back before my flight leaves on September 1.\r\n\r\nWhen I got home, I disabled the script that plays music to wake me up in the morning -- I still don't quite believe it, but I won't need to get up regularly at any certain time for the next year at least.",

    "post_content": "In the last few days I have spent tedious hours on hold with British Telecom trying to cancel my service, and more hours wrapping various possessions first in tissue paper, subsequently in t-shirts, and finally in rubber bands with index card labels (very eco-friendly, I thought -- I haven't used any bubble wrap at all, and I have to ship the t-shirts anyway).\r\n\r\nOf course one benefit of all this tedium is heightened anticipation of my coming freedom, but there was practical and artistic benefit as well:  Practically, I learned that you can dial 170 70 in the UK and an automated service will tell you what number you are calling from.  This is useful if you only got a phone line because British Telecom requires one to get broadband service (and so can't remember your own phone number); according to the BT operator, it's also useful if you are over at someone's house and want to know your host's phone number (I thought this was shady advice from BT).  On the artistic side, while improvising a carrier for my formal cufflinks, I unintentionally created a <a title=\"Domo-kun images\" href=\"http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=domo+kun&amp;spell=1\" target=\"_blank\">Domo-kun<\/a>-like monster.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/domokun.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-199\" title=\"domokun\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/domokun.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nWhen I was in San Francisco on short notice, I had to buy some new cufflinks, so I went to the Pink store and bought three versions of the same cufflinks in red, yellow, and blue.  When I was back home in Tokyo, a friend of mine saw them sitting together on their little tray and said, Oh, it looks like a stoplight.  I didn't think it was funny at the time, because I know that Japanese people call the bottom light of a stoplight \"blue\" (and the stoplight itself will tell you in its mechanical voice when it's safe to walk:  \"Ao ni narimashita,\" which means, \"It turned blue.\")\r\n\r\nBut when I was packing them today, I realized that what is strange is not that the Japanese word \"ao\" refers to stoplights -- in fact, it's easy to imagine an English color word like \"sea-colored\" that could refer to a range of things that are blue or green.  It is strange, however, that someone looking at bright blue cufflinks would think that they <em>looked<\/em> like the green light of a stoplight.  Does using the color-word blue for green things influence perception, or is Japanese perception different from mine?  (They call the sun \"red\", too, and little kids in Japan drawing a sun will choose the red crayon.)\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #551a8b; text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/stoplight1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-209\" title=\"stoplight\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/stoplight1.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>\r\n<\/span>",

    "post_content": "When I was trying to set my last day at work, I angled for July 4th as an auspicious day -- America's Independence Day seemed like a good day to be free of a job.  A month's notice was too little for the team, it transpired, so we set August 1 as the day, a Friday.  The following Friday might have been an even better date:  08\/08\/08 would be hard to forget.\r\n\r\nAt least a year ago, I predicted a spike in weddings and Caesarian sections on today's date as people try to arrange a favorable beginning for these events.  I read recently that entrepreneurs in Beijing were capitalizing on the first circumstance by booking wedding halls for August 8, then hiring them out at higher rates to less foresightful couples.  For the second part, I don't know for sure that the number of births will increase, or that anyone has figured out a way to make money from it, but I think it's likely that anyone who was already planning a C-section around this time will go for the 8th, and that some people who weren't planning one for medical reasons will do so anyway.  I base this on the decision of a university friend to arrange 03\/03\/03 as his daughter's birthday via C-section, motivated only by the desire for symmetry.\r\n\r\nOf course the other big event starting out today is the Beijing Olympics.  Put births and the games together and you get this recent headline:  \"Over 3500 children named 'Olympics' in China\".  If \"Porsche\" and \"Mercedes\" are legitimate aspirational names, maybe \"Gold Medal\" should be too.",

But whatever else people said, pretty much everyone said some version of the following:<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Make a plan -- it's very easy to let the time drift by and find your break is over before you know it.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Budget about four months to recover\/decompress\/get back to your old self\/repair your spirit (none of these phrases is my own...) after you quit working.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Don't buy a round-the-world ticket -- you'll almost certainly find a reason to stay in one place longer than your plan (see 1) called for.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<div>I have a plan (of sorts), but I did buy a round-the-world ticket in spite of the advice.  I will be sure to record my verdict on such tickets when (if) I make it to my destination.<\/div>\r\n<\/div>",

    "post_content": "Since all of my time is currently free time, I've been spending a lot of it in parks and pubs, and \"measuring out my life with coffee spoons\" in cafes.  Sometimes, I get to talk to strangers.\r\n\r\nI was in the Crown and Anchor, writing in my journal, when I noticed a scruffy but pretty girl drinking a beer and reading Bertrand Russell's <em>A History of Western Philosophy<\/em>.  I assumed she was a philosophy student (as I was myself once).  She asked me to watch her stuff or a minute, and when she got back I asked her if she was carrying that heavy tome for self-defense on the mean streets of London, or if it was for a course.  It turns out she's doing a philosophy degree at UCL.\r\n\r\nIt may be that reading technique has declined since I was a student:  hers involved moving her head side-to-side as if she were watching a miniature tennis match taking place on the pages of her book.  I got the impression from this that the book was a little bit for show, and that she was absorbing more Beck's that Bertrand.  Philosophy students weren't pretentious back in my day, oh no.\r\n\r\nFor laughs, I was tempted to ask, \"What are you going to do with a degree in philosophy?\"  But I didn't, as I know from experience how annoying that question can be.  Instead, I confessed that I had done a degree in philosophy, followed shortly by another.  I should have added, \"And now I'm unemployed.\"\r\n\r\nI'm reading <em>The Undercover Economist<\/em> (which itself struggles with pretension); it had this analysis of the value of philosophy degrees:\r\n<blockquote>Spence himself first used his insight to show why students might choose to pursue a degree in philosophy, which is difficult but does not lead to specific career opportunities, like an economics degree or a marketing degree.  Assume that employers would like to hire smart, diligent workers but can't tell from an interview who is smart or diligent.  Assume also that everyone has to work hard to obtain a philosophy degree, but lazy, dumb people find it particularly troublesome.\r\n\r\nSpence then shows that smart, diligent people can prove they're smart and diligent by going to the trouble of getting a philosophy degree.  It's not that lazy, dumb people can't get that degree but that they wouldn't want to:  employers will pay philosophy graduates enough to compensate them for the trouble but not enough to persuade lazy, dumb people to bother.  The employers are willing to do this despite the fact that the philosophy degree itself does not improve the candidate's productivity at all.  It is merely a credible signal, because a philosophy degree is too much trouble for lazy, dumb people to acquire.<\/blockquote>\r\nIs this an accurate analysis?  A friend of mine was studying for a mid-term in a course called Gemstones and Gemology.  I said, are you really going to get college credit for a course on jewelry?  She came back with, What are you studying?  Aristotle?  What use is that to anybody?  So I bet her that I could take the practice exam she was working on and that Aristotle would help me do better than she did with her three months of lectures and study.\r\n\r\nI took the test.  Not only did I beat my friend's score, I got everything right.  Why?  Aristotle is the foundation of western science.  If you understand Aristotle, you understand how scientific problems are formulated.  In addition, since he started the tradition and his disciples continue it, much of scientific terminology is in Greek or Latin.  I don't have to take a class to tell me what \"anisotropic\" means -- the word itself tells me, and I can guess from it (for example) that stones with anisotropic crystal configurations are opaque.  (This sort of thing is why it's still worth studying Greek*, even for the pragmatically minded.)  Finally, as the founder of syllogistic logic, Aristotle gives insight into contradictions that allow a test-taker to eliminate incorrect options and to see how questions later in the exam illuminate earlier ones.\r\n\r\nThis is a roundabout way of objecting to the assertion that philosophy \"does not improve the candidate's productivity\".  I think philosophy, like mathematics or other problem-solving disciplines, does increase productivity by giving students tools to analyze problems and to accelerate learning.  And I doubt that most students who study philosophy choose the degree to signal diligence and brains to potential employers -- there are more direct ways of doing this, and most philosophy students don't think about future employment at all**.  Being able to do your coursework in the pub is probably a much more important factor.\r\n\r\n*  I was flipping through a book called something like <em>The Smartest Guy in the World<\/em> in an airport bookstore, about someone who read everything he could to be a success on the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.  I put it down when he confessed that the multiple-choice question he missed was, \"What are red blood cells called?\"  One of the answers, erythrocyte, means \"red cell\" in Greek.  Can't be that smart.\r\n\r\n** A friend of mine wrote a comic that I thought was funny at university:  A guy is standing behind a cash register and the customer asks, \"Where's my change?\"  The guy answers, \"True change comes from within.\"  The caption is, \"Why philosophy majors have trouble finding a job.\"",

He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him; or the old laws be expanded, and interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense, and he will live with the license of a higher order of beings.<\/span><\/p>",

There are plenty of potential customers (i.e., lost people) there, but I don't know how many are happy to be asked to pay to become unlost.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/witchhat.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-448 aligncenter\" title=\"Witch Hat\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/witchhat.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"130\" height=\"94\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nI have spent a day or two drawing maps of Covent Garden from memory.  I originally pictured Covent Garden as a pennant on the mast of Monmouth Street, but after playing with a few drawings, it seems more appropriate to think of it as a hat, specifically a witch's hat:  its shape is more irregular than the perfect triangle of a pennant, and the \"Covent\" of Covent Garden is perfectly balanced between <em>convent<\/em> (a religious residence for religious brothers or especially sisters) and <em>coven<\/em> (a congregation of witches).\r\n\r\nBoth come from the same Latin word <em>convenire<\/em>, to come together or convene.  The double rectangle of the garden and the Opera House makes a perfect buckle, and imagining a Union Jack patch at the western edge of Shelton Street makes it easy to reconstruct Seven Dials from memory.\r\n\r\nHere's the outline in the correct north-south orientation.  I left out most of the internal streets to make the witch hat shape clear.  This drawing fits exactly over the mini A-Z:  I took no artistic license!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-451\" title=\"coventgarden\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/coventgarden.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/>",

    "post_content": "Today is grey and gloomy in London, with spattering rain.  Typical mid-summer weather!  Maybe because of the rain, but probably partly because I'm leaving soon, a poem I memorized at university was running through my head today.  The original is German, here's a translation:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h4>The Flying Robert<\/h4>\r\nEscapism, you cry out to me, \r\nreproachfully. \r\nWhat else, I reply, \r\nwith this lousy weather! \r\nI open my umbrella \r\nand launch myself into the winds. \r\nFrom your point of view \r\nI become smaller and smaller, \r\nuntil I vanish. \r\nI leave behind nothing \r\nbut a legend, \r\nwith which you green-eyed monsters \r\npester your children, \r\nwhen it storms outside, \r\nso that they do not fly away from you.\r\n\r\n  — Hans Magnus Enzensberger<\/blockquote>\r\n \"You green-eyed monsters\" is a loose translation of \"ihr Neidhammel\" (you envious people) in the original.  \"Hammel\" is <em>wether<\/em> in English, and if you grew up on a ranch you might recognize that word, but if not, you probably think it's a typo for \"weather\" or \"whether\".  It means a castrated male sheep, the sheep-world equivalent of a steer.  That may seem like an obscure word, unless you recognize it as part of \"bellwether\", a word you've probably used.\r\n\r\nHere's the original:\r\n \r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h4>Der fliegende Robert<\/h4>\r\nEskapismus, ruft ihr mir zu, \r\nvorwurfsvoll. \r\nWas denn sonst, antworte ich, \r\nbei diesem Sauwetter! -, \r\nspanne den Regenschirm auf \r\nund erhebe mich in die Lüfte. \r\nVon euch aus gesehen, \r\nwerde ich immer kleiner und kleiner, \r\nbis ich verschwunden bin. \r\nIch hinterlasse nichts weiter \r\nals eine Legende, \r\nmit der ihr Neidhammel, \r\nwenn es draußen stürmt, \r\neuern Kindern in den Ohren liegt, \r\ndamit sie euch nicht davonfliegen.\r\n\r\n— Hans Magnus Enzensberger<\/blockquote>",

I think it's because I feel like the \"pipeline\" is still full.\r\n\r\nI will license the following metaphor to the first management guru to write in:  As an employee, you are an avalanche victim -- you are buried in snow (work), and your job is to dig your way out.  Part of what you are paid for is to prioritize correctly -- there's always more to do than one person can accomplish.  You need to pick the correct direction (up, or at least upward), the right tools, and the right technique to make progress while the snow continues to accumulate above you.  If you dig deeper, or dig upward but try to make the hole bigger than necessary, or if you use your hands when you have tools, you won't make enough progress.  You don't have to shovel all the snow, just enough to get up to the surface.  (OK, maybe this metaphor needs some work.)  Anyway, I wake up every morning ready to dig, even though the things I still have to arrange before I leave should take less than a week.  All the pressure of work waiting to be done is more or less imaginary.\r\n\r\nMy friends who have taken sabbaticals have not been encouraging:  they say it takes four months to stop feeling like that.",

A lot of websites discuss Eine and his alphabet, but not a single one mentions the thing that I think explains their appeal:  these letters on square shutters look like children's alphabet blocks.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-475\" title=\"x\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"79\" height=\"74\" \/>",

I've learned to invite my \"mates\" back to my \"gaff\" (invite my homies back to my crib, yo) and to pronounce Bethnal Green like the locals do (Beffnal Green).  Both are good for a laugh coming from an American.\n\nI get lessons from strangers, too.  Today as I was walking through the West End, I stopped by Fortnum and Mason to get a snack to eat in the park.  I settled on a pork pie, and asked the clerk if he could heat it up, to which he replied, \"The pork pie likes to be eaten cold, sir.\"  I thought this was a pleasantly indirect way of telling me how to act (a lesson in itself!).  I said, \"OK, let's do what the pork pie wants.\"",

    "post_content": "It seems obvious when you say it, but you meet a different set of people wandering around London during the day than you do working in a bank.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I walked from Covent Garden to Primrose Hill to see the view.  The most prominent part of the southern horizon was the nest of mechanical cranes on almost every building.  I counted 54 of them.\r\n\r\nSince it was Monday morning, there were just a few moms out with their kids, an older, perhaps retired, couple, and me...and a community police officer (or at least a guy dressed like one).\r\n\r\nI was reading my book on one of the benches when the officer sat down at the other end of it.  All the other benches in the park were empty, but he sat next to me and started talking about the weather, the relative absence of people in the park, and how he likes to have fun at work, \"because otherwise, what's the point?\"  He asked my name, I told him, and he said, \"Ah, like Robert Redford.  And you have his same golden hair and good looks.\"  Was a cop hitting on me?  I wonder what the residents of Primrose Hill would think about the kind of fun in the park their council taxes are supporting.\r\n\r\nOn the way home I saw again the guy who stands on the corner of Garrick Street calling out, \"If you are lost or need information\".  I wanted to ask him something to see what he was up to (performance art? an entrepreneur? a shy person trying to become bolder?), but all I could think to ask were questions that would sound facetious (e.g., Where is the nearest undiscovered horde of Roman coins?).\r\n\r\n\"If you need information\", is a very open-ended offer, however, and if I see him again I will definitely find out what he is up to.  Maybe he is exploiting the Pareto Principle and asking for a fee from the 80% who want to find Covent Garden, the British Museum, or the tube station.  For the rest, he can just say he doesn't know.  If that's the game, I've missed an opportunity by helping all those lost people for free.",

I don't think folks in technology give this much thought, but their trajectory is different from that of the business team (this applies mainly to the \"partnerships\" we develop in finance -- if I were working for a technology firm, the following wouldn't be as relevant).  The IT \"earning curve\" starts off much higher than that of the typical business team member, but is flatter, which means that at some point, after more or less time being more valuable (as measured by compensation), technology is left in the dust.

I read recently that entrepreneurs in Beijing were capitalizing on the first circumstance by booking wedding halls for August 8, then hiring them out at higher rates to less foresightful couples.  For the second part, I don't know for sure that the number of births will increase, or that anyone has figured out a way to make money from it, but I think it's likely that anyone who was already planning a C-section in Asia around this time will go for the 8th, and that some people who weren't planning one for medical reasons will do so.  I base this on the decision of a university friend to arrange 03\/03\/03 as his daughter's birthday via C-section, motivated only by the desire for symmetry.\r\n\r\nOf course the other big event starting out today is the Beijing Olympics.  Put births and the games together and you get this recent headline:  \"Over 3500 children named 'Olympics' in China\".  If \"Porsche\" and \"Mercedes\" are legitimate aspirational names, maybe \"Gold Medal\" should be too.",

    "post_content": "At least a year ago, I predicted a spike in weddings and Caesarian sections on today's date as people try to arrange a favorable beginning for these events.  I read recently that entrepreneurs in Beijing were capitalizing on the first circumstance by booking wedding halls for August 8, then hiring them out at higher rates to less foresightful couples.  For the second part, I don't know for sure that the number of births will increase, or that anyone has figured out a way to make money from it, but I think it's likely that anyone who was already planning a C-section around this time will go for the 8th, and that some people who weren't planning one for medical reasons will do so anyway.  I base this on the decision of a university friend to arrange 03\/03\/03 as his daughter's birthday via C-section, motivated only by the desire for symmetry.\r\n\r\nOf course the other big event starting out today is the Beijing Olympics.  Put births and the games together and you get this recent headline:  \"Over 3500 children named 'Olympics' in China\".  If \"Porsche\" and \"Mercedes\" are legitimate aspirational names, maybe \"Gold Medal\" should be too.",

    "post_content": "It seems obvious when you say it, but you meet a different set of people wandering around London during the day than you do working in a bank.\n\nYesterday, I walked from Covent Garden to Primrose Hill to see the view.  The most prominent part of the southern horizon was the nest of mechanical cranes on almost every building.  I counted 54 of them.\n\n \n\nSince it was Monday morning, there were just a few moms out with their kids, an older, perhaps retired, couple, and me...and a community police officer (or at least a guy dressed like one).\n\n \n\nI was reading my book on one of the benches when the officer sat down at the other end of it.  All the other benches in the park were empty, but he sat next to me and started talking about the weather, the relative absence of people in the park, and how he likes to have fun at work, \"because otherwise, what's the point?\"  He asked my name, I told him, and he said, \"Ah, like Robert Redford.  And you have his same golden hair and good looks.\"  Was a cop hitting on me?  I wonder what the residents of Primrose Hill would think about the kind of fun in the park their council taxes are supporting.\n\n \n\nOn the way home I saw again the guy who stands on the corner of Garrick Street calling out, \"If you are lost or need information\".  I wanted to ask him something to see what he was up to (performance art? an entrepreneur? a shy person trying to become bolder?), but all I could think to ask were questions that would sound facetious (e.g., Where is the nearest undiscovered horde of Roman coins?).\n\n \n\n\"If you need information\", is a very open-ended offer, however, and if I see him again I will definitely find out what he is up to.  Maybe he is exploiting the Pareto Principle and asking for a fee from the 80% who want to find Covent Garden, the British Museum, or the tube station.  For the rest, he can just say he doesn't know.  If that's the game, I've missed an opportunity by helping all those lost people for free.\n<div><\/div>",

    "post_content": "Since all of my time is currently free time, I've been spending a lot of it in parks and pubs, and \"measuring out my life with coffee spoons\" in cafes.  Sometimes, I get to talk to strangers.\r\n\r\nI was in the Crown and Anchor, writing in my journal, when a woman sat next to me, ordered a pint, and opened Bertrand Russell's <em>A History of Western Philosophy<\/em>.  I assumed she was a philosophy student (as I was myself once), because of the book and because she was somewhat scruffy.  She asked me to watch her stuff for a minute, and when she got back I asked her if she was carrying that heavy tome for self-defense on the mean streets of London, or if it was for a course.  It turns out she's doing a philosophy degree at UCL.\r\n\r\nIt may be that reading technique has declined since I was a student:  hers involved moving her head side-to-side as if she were watching a miniature tennis match taking place on the pages of her book.  I got the impression from this that the book was a little bit for show, and that she was absorbing more beer than Bertrand.  Philosophy students weren't pretentious back in my day, oh no.\r\n\r\nFor laughs, I was tempted to ask, \"What are you going to do with a degree in philosophy?\"  I didn't, as I know from experience how annoying that question can be.  Instead, I confessed that I had done a degree in philosophy, followed shortly by another.  I should have added, \"And now I'm unemployed.\"\r\n\r\nI'm reading <em>The Undercover Economist<\/em> (which itself struggles with pretension); it had this analysis of the value of philosophy degrees:\r\n<blockquote>Spence himself first used his insight to show why students might choose to pursue a degree in philosophy, which is difficult but does not lead to specific career opportunities, like an economics degree or a marketing degree.  Assume that employers would like to hire smart, diligent workers but can't tell from an interview who is smart or diligent.  Assume also that everyone has to work hard to obtain a philosophy degree, but lazy, dumb people find it particularly troublesome.\r\n\r\nSpence then shows that smart, diligent people can prove they're smart and diligent by going to the trouble of getting a philosophy degree.  It's not that lazy, dumb people can't get that degree but that they wouldn't want to:  employers will pay philosophy graduates enough to compensate them for the trouble but not enough to persuade lazy, dumb people to bother.  The employers are willing to do this despite the fact that the philosophy degree itself does not improve the candidate's productivity at all.  It is merely a credible signal, because a philosophy degree is too much trouble for lazy, dumb people to acquire.<\/blockquote>\r\nIs this an accurate analysis?  A friend of mine was studying for a mid-term in a course called Gemstones and Gemology.  I said, \"Are you really going to get college credit for a course on jewelry?\"  She came back with, \"What are you studying?  Aristotle?  What use is that to anybody?\"  So I bet her that I could take the practice exam she was working on and that Aristotle would help me do better than she had after three months of lectures on the subject.\r\n\r\nI took the test.  Not only did I beat my friend's score, I got everything right.  Why?  Aristotle is the foundation of western science.  If you understand Aristotle, you understand how scientific problems are formulated.  In addition, since he started the tradition and his disciples continue it, much of scientific terminology is in Greek or Latin.  I don't have to take a class to tell me what \"anisotropic\" means -- the word itself tells me, and I can guess from it (for example) that anisotropic gems split light in different directions.  (This sort of thing is why it's still worth studying Greek*, even for the pragmatically minded.)  Finally, as the founder of syllogistic logic, Aristotle gives insight into contradictions that allow a test-taker to eliminate incorrect options and to see how questions later in the exam illuminate earlier ones.\r\n\r\nThis is a roundabout way of objecting to the assertion that philosophy \"does not improve the candidate's productivity\".  I think philosophy, like mathematics or other problem-solving disciplines, does increase productivity by giving students tools to analyze problems and to accelerate learning.  And I doubt that most students who study philosophy choose the degree to signal diligence and brains to potential employers -- there are more direct ways of doing this, and most philosophy students don't think about future employment at all**.  Being able to do your coursework in the pub is probably a much more important factor.\r\n\r\n*  I was flipping through a book called something like <em>The Smartest Guy in the World<\/em> in an airport bookstore, about someone who read everything he could to be a success on the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.  I put it down when he confessed that the multiple-choice question he missed was, \"What are red blood cells called?\"  One of the answers, <em>erythrocyte<\/em>, means \"red cell\" in Greek.  Can't be that smart.\r\n\r\n** A friend of mine wrote a comic that I thought was funny at university:  A guy is standing behind a cash register and the customer asks, \"Where's my change?\"  The guy answers, \"<a title=\"True change comes from within\" href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/boblog\/true-change-comes-from-within\/\" target=\"_self\">True change comes from within<\/a>.\"  The caption is, \"Why philosophy majors have trouble finding a job.\"",

    "post_content": "Since all of my time is currently free time, I've been spending a lot of it in parks and pubs, and \"measuring out my life with coffee spoons\" in cafes.  Sometimes, I get to talk to strangers.\r\n\r\nI was in the Crown and Anchor, writing in my journal, when I noticed a scruffy but pretty girl drinking a beer and reading Bertrand Russell's <em>A History of Western Philosophy<\/em>.  I assumed she was a philosophy student (as I was myself once).  She asked me to watch her stuff or a minute, and when she got back I asked her if she was carrying that heavy tome for self-defense on the mean streets of London, or if it was for a course.  It turns out she's doing a philosophy degree at UCL.\r\n\r\nIt may be that reading technique has declined since I was a student:  hers involved moving her head side-to-side as if she were watching a miniature tennis match taking place on the pages of her book.  I got the impression from this that the book was a little bit for show, and that she was absorbing more Beck's that Bertrand.  Philosophy students weren't pretentious back in my day, oh no.\r\n\r\nFor laughs, I was tempted to ask, \"What are you going to do with a degree in philosophy?\"  But I didn't, as I know from experience how annoying that question can be.  Instead, I confessed that I had done a degree in philosophy, followed shortly by another.  I should have added, \"And now I'm unemployed.\"\r\n\r\nI'm reading <em>The Undercover Economist<\/em> (which itself struggles with pretension); it had this analysis of the value of philosophy degrees:\r\n<blockquote>Spence himself first used his insight to show why students might choose to pursue a degree in philosophy, which is difficult but does not lead to specific career opportunities, like an economics degree or a marketing degree.  Assume that employers would like to hire smart, diligent workers but can't tell from an interview who is smart or diligent.  Assume also that everyone has to work hard to obtain a philosophy degree, but lazy, dumb people find it particularly troublesome.\r\n\r\nSpence then shows that smart, diligent people can prove they're smart and diligent by going to the trouble of getting a philosophy degree.  It's not that lazy, dumb people can't get that degree but that they wouldn't want to:  employers will pay philosophy graduates enough to compensate them for the trouble but not enough to persuade lazy, dumb people to bother.  The employers are willing to do this despite the fact that the philosophy degree itself does not improve the candidate's productivity at all.  It is merely a credible signal, because a philosophy degree is too much trouble for lazy, dumb people to acquire.<\/blockquote>\r\nIs this an accurate analysis?  A friend of mine was studying for a mid-term in a course called Gemstones and Gemology.  I said, are you really going to get college credit for a course on jewelry?  She came back with, What are you studying?  Aristotle?  What use is that to anybody?  So I bet her that I could take the practice exam she was working on and that Aristotle would help me do better than she did with her three months of lectures and study.\r\n\r\nI took the test.  Not only did I beat my friend's score, I got everything right.  Why?  Aristotle is the foundation of western science.  If you understand Aristotle, you understand how scientific problems are formulated.  In addition, since he started the tradition and his disciples continue it, much of scientific terminology is in Greek or Latin.  I don't have to take a class to tell me what \"anisotropic\" means -- the word itself tells me, and I can guess from it (for example) that stones with anisotropic crystal configurations are opaque.  (This sort of thing is why it's still worth studying Greek*, even for the pragmatically minded.)  Finally, as the founder of syllogistic logic, Aristotle gives insight into contradictions that allow a test-taker to eliminate incorrect options and to see how questions later in the exam illuminate earlier ones.\r\n\r\nThis is a roundabout way of objecting to the assertion that philosophy \"does not improve the candidate's productivity\".  I think philosophy, like mathematics or other problem-solving disciplines, does increase productivity by giving students tools to analyze problems and to accelerate learning.  And I doubt that most students who study philosophy choose the degree to signal diligence and brains to potential employers -- there are more direct ways of doing this, and most philosophy students don't think about future employment at all**.  Being able to do your coursework in the pub is probably a much more important factor.\r\n\r\n*  I was flipping through a book called something like <em>The Smartest Guy in the World<\/em> in an airport bookstore, about someone who read everything he could to be a success on the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.  I put it down when he confessed that the multiple-choice question he missed was, \"What are red blood cells called?\"  One of the answers, erythrocyte, means \"red cell\" in Greek.  Can't be that smart.\r\n\r\n** A friend of mine wrote a comic that I thought was funny at university:  A guy is standing behind a cash register and the customer asks, \"Where's my change?\"  The guy answers, \"True change comes from within.\"  The caption is, \"Why philosophy majors have trouble finding a job.\"",

    "post_content": "It seems obvious when you say it, but you meet a different set of people wandering around London during the day than you do working in a bank.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I walked from Covent Garden to Primrose Hill to see the view.  The most prominent part of the southern horizon was the nest of mechanical cranes on almost every building.  I counted 54 of them.\r\n\r\nSince it was Monday morning, there were just a few moms out with their kids, an older, perhaps retired, couple, and me...and a community police officer (or at least a guy dressed like one).\r\n\r\nI was reading my book on one of the benches when the officer sat down at the other end of it.  All the other benches in the park were empty, but he sat next to me and started talking about the weather, the relative absence of people in the park, and how he likes to have fun at work, \"because otherwise, what's the point?\"  He asked my name, I told him, and he said, \"Ah, like Robert Redford.  And you have his same golden hair and good looks.\"  Was a cop hitting on me?  I wonder what the residents of Primrose Hill would think about the kind of fun in the park their council taxes are supporting.\r\n\r\nOn the way home I saw again the guy who stands on the corner of Garrick Street calling out, \"If you are lost or need information\".  I wanted to ask him something to see what he was up to (performance art? an entrepreneur? a shy person trying to become bolder?), but all I could think to ask were questions that would sound facetious (e.g., Where is the nearest undiscovered horde of Roman coins?).\r\n\r\n\"If you need information\", is a very open-ended offer, however, and if I see him again I will definitely find out what he is up to.  Maybe he is exploiting the Pareto Principle and asking for a fee from the 80% who want to find Covent Garden, the British Museum, or the tube station.  For the rest, he can just say he doesn't know.  If that's the game, I've missed an opportunity by helping all those lost people for free.",

I had planned on watching the Sopranos through to the finale, and maybe playing some video games.  Manny's pad in Covent Garden has all the important mod cons:  42\" plasma TV, Xbox, Wii <strong>and<\/strong> PS3.  Why wait?\r\n\r\nWe bought Grand Theft Auto IV on Wednesday and it took until just after midnight to learn to drive, fight, shoot and take the Michelle character out on dates.  On Thursday I played from about 2:00p until I had acquired a set of body armor, a knife, a pistol, a shotgun and a police car about six hours later.  Then we were ready to really start playing.\r\n\r\nMost days we've been up until around 1:00a playing, and that was exercising real discipline.  I'm not sure that playing a violent game like GTA makes you more likely to commit violent acts in real life, but I know that after playing for three solid days it does affect your perception.  In the game, if you beat up or run over a character, any cash he has falls out of his pockets and glows green.  I was walking down Neal Street on Friday and saw a fluorescent green plastic spoon from the local gelato place glowing in the sun on the cobblestones.  My first thought was, \"Ooh, money.\"",

I also think that you probably gain fluency in different domains more quickly.  Many gaijin are fluent in \"Taxi Japanese\", and can get home from any part of the city, but many of them have no other Japanese language competence.\r\n\r\nI began to suspect that I was gaining general fluency in Japanese the day I got on the train at Shinjuku station, then immediately jumped off when the conductor announced that it would be an express train (which skips my station).  I didn't have time to reflect on or translate the announcement -- I reacted to the words subconsciously.\r\n\r\nIn France, I met an apple farmer during a bike ride to Mont-Saint-Michel.  After some minutes of conversation, he asked if I were Breton.  No one would mistake me for French (there are not many 6'4\" blond Frenchmen), but to be mistaken for the Celtic minority of Bretagne made me realize my studying had paid off.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, a good comeback made me feel like I had reached a degree of fluency in everyday conversation.  I was in the student cafeteria (the Mensa), testing bottles of soda to find a cold one.  I finally took one from the back of the rack, and the server scolded me in German:  \"They are all the same!\"  I said without thinking:  \"Then it doesn't matter which one I take, does it?\"",

I've learned to invite my \"mates\" back to my \"gaff\" (invite my homies back to my crib, yo) and to pronounce Bethnal Green like the locals do (Beffnal Green).  Both are good for a laugh, since no one expects an American to talk like that.\r\n\r\nI get lessons from strangers, too.  Today as I was walking through the West End, I stopped by Fortnum and Mason to get a snack to eat in the park.  I settled on a pork pie, and asked the clerk if he could heat it up, to which he replied, \"The pork pie likes to be eaten cold, sir.\"  I thought this was a pleasantly indirect way of telling me how to act (a lesson in itself!).  I said, \"OK, let's do what the pork pie wants.\"",

That's what the Thailand trip cost per year.  I also read in a travel article on \"gap years\" that the average student year off costs just under $10,000.  The maximum of $36,000 was for the Africa trip (the shortest one!), but that was someone who wanted to get the most out of his relatively limited travel time (and was well beyond living as a student).<\/div>\r\nPeople have very vague memories of what their trips cost, even though that's the subject that other people planning such a trip are most keenly interested in.  When I move to a new country, I try to write down every expense for the first six months I am there to teach my subconscious how to estimate cash flow in the new location.

That's what the Thailand trip cost per year.  I also read in a travel article on \"gap years\" that the average student year off costs just under $10,000.  The maximum of $36,000 was for the Africa trip (the shortest one!), but that was someone who wanted to get the most out of his relatively limited travel time (and was well beyond living as a student).<\/div>\nPeople have very vague memories of what their trips cost, even though that's the subject that other people planning such a trip are most keenly interested in.  When I move to a new country, I try to write down every expense for the first six months I am there to teach my subconscious how to estimate cash flow in the new location.

    "post_content": "Today is grey and gloomy in London, with spattering rain.  Typical mid-summer weather!  Maybe because of the rain, but probably partly because I'm leaving soon, a poem I memorized at university was running through my head today.  The original is German, here's a translation:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h4>The Flying Robert<\/h4>\r\nEscapism, you cry out to me, \r\nreproachfully. \r\nWhat else, I reply, \r\nwith this lousy weather! \r\nI open my umbrella \r\nand launch myself into the winds. \r\nFrom your point of view \r\nI become smaller and smaller, \r\nuntil I vanish. \r\nI leave behind nothing \r\nbut a legend, \r\nwith which you green-eyed monsters \r\npester your children, \r\nwhen it storms outside, \r\nso that they do not fly away from you.\r\n\r\n  — Hans Magnus Enzensberger<\/blockquote>\r\n \r\n\"You green-eyed monsters\" is a loose translation of \"ihr Neidhammel\" (you envious people) in the original.  \"Hammel\" is <em>wether<\/em> in English, and if you grew up on a ranch you might recognize that word, but if not, you probably think it's a typo for \"weather\" or \"whether\".  It means a castrated male sheep, the sheep-world equivalent of a steer.  That may seem like an obscure word, unless you recognize it as part of \"bellwether\", a word you've probably used.\r\n\r\nHere's the original:\r\n \r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h4>Der fliegende Robert<\/h4>\r\nEskapismus, ruft ihr mir zu, \r\nvorwurfsvoll. \r\nWas denn sonst, antworte ich, \r\nbei diesem Sauwetter! -, \r\nspanne den Regenschirm auf \r\nund erhebe mich in die Lüfte. \r\nVon euch aus gesehen, \r\nwerde ich immer kleiner und kleiner, \r\nbis ich verschwunden bin. \r\nIch hinterlasse nichts weiter \r\nals eine Legende, \r\nmit der ihr Neidhammel, \r\nwenn es draußen stürmt, \r\neuern Kindern in den Ohren liegt, \r\ndamit sie euch nicht davonfliegen.\r\n\r\n— Hans Magnus Enzensberger<\/blockquote>",

    "post_content": "As part of the wealth reduction plan I began by quitting my job, I spent the day giving things away:  A futon from Isetan Tokyo; a magnetic whiteboard I had custom-made according to the golden ratio; a new leather Tumi computer briefcase; five large bookcases; cookbooks, a double boiler, an ice cream scoop, and other kitchen equipment; several \"50 best\" editions of Time Out I had collected (best websites, best breakfasts, best pubs and clubs, etc.).  I decided to get rid of anything I could easily replace.\r\n\r\n<em>Homo economicus<\/em> would reason that it's cheaper to replace commodity items than to ship and store them.  But the main motivation was irrational:  I've had some of this stuff since university, and much of it since I moved to Tokyo over eight years ago.  I believe (am hoping) that after this time off I'll have a different perspective on the world, and perhaps even different ideals and goals.  Do I want to come back to the same furniture?\r\n\r\nI may have less cruft than some people since I've moved long distances often and have had correspondingly many opportunities to purge my possessions.  But most of those moves were made quickly, and I never considered giving away items that still had substantial utility.  Now that I have a few weeks to go through everything carefully, I'm testing things not according to their usefulness, but their replaceability.\r\n\r\nWhy give things away?  I was not really tempted to sell my stuff on eBay largely because I don't want to spend the last two weeks here taking and uploading photos and arranging to meet sometimes flaky potential buyers.  But I <strong>am<\/strong> tempted to haul everything down to Brick Lane or Old Bethnal Green Road where my neighbors sell each other stolen bikes, used combs, half-complete Hogwarts Express train sets, and other inconsequential things from blankets on the sidewalk.  The pre-internet eBay.  I probably don't really want to spend a day doing that either, though, so giving things away is a good option.  My friends (or the local charity shops) benefit, and it turns out that I benefit too:  Manny traded me a new backpack just the right size (and color!) for my trip.",

    "post_content": "[Update:  June 2009]\r\n\r\nI originally had a list of bullet points on this page highlighting the cultural insight or potential economic benefits learning Chinese can bring.  But after being in Shanghai for about half a year now, I realize that the main reason I like studying Chinese is that it is so different from any language I already know.  Even Japanese has many, many English (and Portuguese, and German) loan words.  If you don't know the Japanese word for something, you can quite often just say the English word with a Japanese accent and you will be right.  This applies for simple words like \"door\" and \"service\" and to specialized terminology from the domains of finance and computer science.\r\n\r\nChinese doesn't really offer any clues to a native English speaker, so everything you come to understand without having explicitly learned it is a kind of pure revelation.  I think that's what I really like about learning this language.  Now that I have a foundation, I am looking forward to some more travel to see how much I can build on it.",

    "post_content": "One of my goals for this sabbatical was to absorb some of the pop culture I missed out on while living in Tokyo for so long.  I had planned on renting Heroes, watching the Sopranos through to the finale, and playing some video games.  Manny's pad in Covent Garden has all the important mod cons:  42\" plasma TV, Xbox, Wii <strong>and<\/strong> PS3.  Why wait?\r\n\r\nWe bought Grand Theft Auto IV on Wednesday and it took until just after midnight to learn to drive, fight, shoot and take the Michelle character out on dates.  On Thursday I played from about 2:00p until I had acquired a set of body armor, a knife, a pistol, a shotgun and a police car about six hours later.  Then we were ready to really start playing.\r\n\r\nMost days we've been up until around 1:00a playing, and that was exercising real discipline.  I'm not sure that playing a violent game like GTA makes you more likely to commit violent acts in real life, but I know that after playing for three solid days it does affect your perception.  In the game, if you beat up or run over a character, any cash he has falls out of his pockets and glows green.  I was walking down Neal Street on Friday and saw a fluorescent green plastic spoon from the local gelato place glowing in the sun on the cobblestones.  My first thought was, \"Ooh, money.\"",

    "post_content": "[Update:  June 2009]\n\nI originally had a list of bullet points on this page highlighting the cultural insight or potential economic benefits learning Chinese can bring.  But after being in Shanghai for about half a year now, I realize that the main reason I like studying Chinese is that it is so different from any language I already know.  Even Japanese has many, many English (and Portuguese, and German) loan words.  If you don't know the Japanese word for something, you can quite often just say the English word with a Japanese accent and you will be right.  This applies for simple words like \"door\" and \"service\" and to specialized terminology from the domains of finance and computer science.\n\nChinese doesn't really offer any clues to a native English speaker, so everything you come to understand without having explicitly learned it is a kind of pure revelation.  I think that's what I really like about learning this language.  Now that I have a foundation, I am looking forward to some more travel to see how much I can build on it.",

    "post_content": "In the last few days I have spent tedious hours on hold with British Telecom trying to cancel my service, and more hours wrapping various possessions first in tissue paper, subsequently in t-shirts, and finally in rubber bands with index card labels (very eco-friendly, I thought -- I haven't used any bubble wrap at all, and I have to ship the t-shirts anyway).\r\n\r\nOf course one benefit of all this tedium is heightened anticipation of my coming freedom, but there was practical and artistic benefit as well:  Practically, I learned that you can dial 170 70 in the UK and an automated service will tell you what number you are calling from.  This is useful if you only got a phone line because BT requires one to get broadband service (and so can't remember your own phone number); according to the BT operator, it's also useful if you are over at someone's house and want to know your host's phone number (I thought this was shady advice from BT).  On the artistic side, while improvising a carrier for my formal cufflinks, I unintentionally created a <a title=\"Domo-kun images\" href=\"http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=domo+kun&amp;spell=1\" target=\"_blank\">Domo-kun<\/a>-like monster.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/domokun.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-199\" title=\"domokun\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/domokun.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nWhen I was in San Francisco on short notice, I had to buy some new cufflinks, so I went to the Pink store and bought three versions of the same cufflinks in red, yellow, and blue.  When I was back home in Tokyo, a friend of mine saw them sitting together on their little tray and said, Oh, it looks like a stoplight.  I didn't think it was funny at the time, because I know that Japanese people call the bottom light of a stoplight \"blue\" (and the stoplight itself will tell you in its mechanical voice when it's safe to walk:  \"Ao ni narimashita,\" which means, \"It turned blue.\")\r\n\r\nBut when I was packing them today, I realized that what is strange is not that the Japanese word \"ao\" refers to stoplights -- in fact, it's easy to imagine an English color word like \"sea-colored\" that could refer to a range of things that are blue or green.  It is strange, however, that someone looking at bright blue cufflinks would think that they <em>looked<\/em> like the green light of a stoplight.  Does using the color-word blue for green things influence perception, or is Japanese perception different from mine?  (They call the sun \"red\", too, and little kids in Japan drawing a sun will choose the red crayon.)\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #551a8b; text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/stoplight1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-209\" title=\"stoplight\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/stoplight1.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>\r\n<\/span>",

    "post_content": "St. Leonard's is the \"when I grow rich\" church at the top of Shoreditch High Street, nestled among the strip clubs, council houses and bars, and watching over the gradual accretion of art galleries (including the one I live above) and design stores.  The churchyard is always full of men in long coats sharing bottles, but this looks more and more like a station in their retreat.  As the galleries spread and new businesses like the Days Hotel spring up (bringing understandably bewildered Japanese tourists on package holidays to Hackney Road), the streets are getting busier and less dangerous, and you stand a decent chance now of flagging down a taxi when you need one.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to like about this area, not least the awareness of how quickly it is changing from dangerous to merely \"edgy\":  \"Live East, Die Young\" is a common slogan on hoodies and art student leather jackets; that's not the sort of thing you would wear if \"Murder Mile\" were really still a good description of your neighborhood.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, Manny came by with a van to help me take my things to charity.  On Sunday, I finished my inventory of possessions, and on Monday the movers came and hauled everything away.  It's funny how quickly you can go from being constrained (with furniture, property, and obligations) to being free.  Three days, really.  It's even funnier how much respect you get from other drivers when you're behind the wheel of a big white van -- it looked to Manny and myself like regard for the working man, but maybe it was fear for their paint jobs.\r\n\r\nWhen I was saying my goodbyes, my landlord (an artist and entrepreneur who turned this old handbag factory into a beautiful apartment block) told me, \"The business culture here is aggressive, it goes back to the Angles and the Saxons -- everyone is out for what they can get.  If I were a man your age, I would get out of London and settle somewhere else.\"  I'm not sure if China is going to be any kind of respite from aggressiveness and selfishness, but it will have the advantage of seeming more like a game, since the experience will be filtered through a language and culture that are more foreign to me than the near relation of English.  (What is the American relationship with the British, exactly?  You sometimes hear Brits talk of \"our American cousins\" (when they are being friendly), but I always imagine Britain to be like an uncle -- sometimes literally avuncular, sometimes like the old men in the Monty Python skit who say, \"Back in MY day, our dad used to wake us up four hours before we went to bed, feed us a lump of cold poison, then we had to walk to school barefoot in the snow UPHILL in both directions...kids these days!\")\r\n\r\nThis is some of what I will miss:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Victoria Park, which on Bonfire Night last year hosted one of the best fireworks display I've ever seen (including Edokawa's hanabi)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Broadway Market and the cupcakes (made by a fellow Californian transplant)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Hoxton Square and Curtain Road<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The host of strip clubs within five minutes' walk of my flat (I did intentionally visit every one of them at least once, but I did not spend nearly as much time there as I would have before I lived in Tokyo)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Columbia Road's flower market, and the two restaurants on the east side:  The Sting Ray Globe Cafe and Laxeiro<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Brick Lane and the 24-hour Beigel [sic] Bake<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The outdoor picnic benches at The Vibe Bar<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The vandals\/\"street artists\" who make living in Hackney a kind of treasure hunt:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Banksy<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Eine<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Invader<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The local \"ad-jammer\" whose name I couldn't discover on the web<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/li>\r\n\t<li>New Thayyab's (I guess this is technically in Whitechapel, but it beats all the Bangladeshi places on the more famous Brick Lane by a mile)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Regent's Canal<\/li>\r\n\t<li>All the art galleries<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The accent!

I don't think folks in technology give this much thought, but their trajectory is different from that of the business team (this applies mainly to the \"partnerships\" we develop in finance -- if I were working for a technology firm, the following wouldn't be as relevant).  The IT \"earning curve\" starts off much higher than that of the typical business team member, but is flatter, which means that at some point, after more or less time being more valuable (as measured by compensation), technology is left in the dust.  Here's the chart:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-277\" title=\"Compensation Comparison\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/compcomp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"392\" height=\"320\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis graph is based on real data, but I obscured the actual numbers.  The first jump in the business line is moving from graduate to FTE.  The jump in both lines between -3 and -2 is promotion to principal\/vice president.  The last data point for both series is just a continuation of the previous year's progression to make the trend more visible.  The red dot marks now, where the difference in values is currently just 2.3%.\r\n\r\nWhat this chart shows is that I have exactly this year captured the last of the alpha to be gained from opting for a career in technology.  In the next year or so my business counterparts will outpace me significantly and continue to accelerate.  Saving \"turnabout is fair play\" and \"swings and roundabouts\" for a future discussion, there are two possible responses if I want to avoid this:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Stay on the same curve but increase my y-coordinate (e.g. by changing firms, which usually entails an increase in responsibility and compensation).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Look for a new curve (e.g., by moving to a business team or joining a technology company where I can contribute directly to the bottom line).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWhat is consistent in both alternatives is the need for a move.\r\n<h4>Signs<\/h4>\r\nFinally, there's the omen.  The day after I handed in my resignation, I talked to <a title=\"Schwinger Shanghai Report\" href=\"http:\/\/andrewschwinger.com\" target=\"_blank\">a friend of mine<\/a> on the trading desk in Tokyo.  He said, \"You'll never guess what I did.  I resigned!  And you'll NEVER guess what I'm GOING to do.  I'm moving to Shanghai to study Chinese!\"\r\n\r\nTrying to time the market is a fool's game, but when your signals, your charts, and your buddy all tell you it's time to take a risk, it would be more foolish not to listen.",

    "post_content": "The guy on Garrick Street who calls out, \"If you are lost or require information\" is working for tips.  There are plenty of potential customers (i.e., lost people) there, but I don't know how many are happy to be asked to pay to become unlost.\r\n\r\nI have spent a day or two drawing maps of Covent Garden from memory.  I originally pictured Covent Garden as a pennant on the mast of Monmouth Street, but after playing with a few drawings, it seems more appropriate to think of it as a hat, specifically a witch's hat:  its shape is more irregular than the perfect triangle of a pennant, and the \"Covent\" of Covent Garden is perfectly balanced between <em>convent<\/em> (a religious residence for religious brothers or especially sisters) and <em>coven<\/em> (a congregation of witches).  Both come from the same Latin word <em>convenire<\/em>, to come together or convene.  The double rectangle of the garden and the Opera House makes a perfect buckle, and imagining a Union Jack patch at the western edge of Shelton Street makes it easy to reconstruct Seven Dials from memory.",

    "post_content": "The guy on Garrick Street who calls out, \"If you are lost or require information\" is working for tips.  There are plenty of potential customers (i.e., lost people) there, but I don't know how many are happy to be asked to pay to become unlost.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/witchhat.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-448\" title=\"Witch Hat\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/witchhat.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"130\" height=\"94\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nI have spent a day or two drawing maps of Covent Garden from memory.  I originally pictured Covent Garden as a pennant on the mast of Monmouth Street, but after playing with a few drawings, it seems more appropriate to think of it as a hat, specifically a witch's hat:  its shape is more irregular than the perfect triangle of a pennant, and the \"Covent\" of Covent Garden is perfectly balanced between <em>convent<\/em> (a religious residence for religious brothers or especially sisters) and <em>coven<\/em> (a congregation of witches).  Both come from the same Latin word <em>convenire<\/em>, to come together or convene.  The double rectangle of the garden and the Opera House makes a perfect buckle, and imagining a Union Jack patch at the western edge of Shelton Street makes it easy to reconstruct Seven Dials from memory.",

    "post_content": "It seems obvious when you say it, but you meet a different set of people wandering around London during the day than you do working in a bank.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I walked from Covent Garden to Primrose Hill to see the view.  The most prominent part of the southern horizon was the nest of mechanical cranes on almost every building.  I counted 54 of them.\r\n\r\nSince it was Monday morning, there were just a few moms out with their kids, an older, perhaps retired, couple, and me...and a community police officer (or at least a guy dressed like one).\r\n\r\nI was reading my book on one of the benches when the officer sat down at the other end of it.  All the other benches in the park were empty, but he sat next to me and started talking about the weather, the relative absence of people in the park, and how he likes to have fun at work, \"because otherwise, what's the point?\"  He asked my name, I told him, and he said, \"Ah, like Robert Redford.  And you have his same golden hair and good looks.\"  Was a cop hitting on me?  I wonder what the residents of Primrose Hill would think about the kind of fun in the park their council taxes are supporting.\r\n\r\nOn the way home I saw again the guy who stands on the corner of Garrick Street calling out, \"If you are lost or need information\".  I wanted to ask him something to see what he was up to (performance art? an entrepreneur? a shy person trying to become bolder?), but all I could think to ask were questions that would sound facetious (e.g., Where is the nearest undiscovered horde of Roman coins?).\r\n\r\n\"If you need information\", is a very open-ended offer, however, and if I see him again I will definitely find out what he is up to.  Maybe he is exploiting the Pareto Principle and asking for a fee from the 80% who want to find Covent Garden, the British Museum, or the tube station.  For the rest, he can just say he doesn't know.  If that's the game, I've missed an opportunity by helping all those lost people for free.",

    "post_content": "Since all of my time is currently free time, I've been spending a lot of it in parks and pubs, and \"measuring out my life with coffee spoons\" in cafes.  Sometimes, I get to talk to strangers.\r\n\r\nI was in the Crown and Anchor, writing in my journal, when I noticed a scruffy but pretty girl drinking a beer and reading Bertrand Russell's <em>A History of Western Philosophy<\/em>.  I assumed she was a philosophy student (as I was myself once).  She asked me to watch her stuff or a minute, and when she got back I asked her if she was carrying that heavy tome for self-defense on the mean streets of London, or if it was for a course.  It turns out she's doing a philosophy degree at UCL.\r\n\r\nIt may be that reading technique has declined since I was a student:  hers involved moving her head side-to-side as if she were watching a miniature tennis match taking place on the pages of her book.  I got the impression from this that the book was a little bit for show, and that she was absorbing more Beck's that Bertrand.  Philosophy students weren't pretentious back in my day, oh no.\r\n\r\nFor laughs, I was tempted to ask, \"What are you going to do with a degree in philosophy?\"  But I didn't, as I know from experience how annoying that question can be.  Instead, I confessed that I had done a degree in philosophy, followed shortly by another.  I should have added, \"And now I'm unemployed.\"\r\n\r\nI'm reading <em>The Undercover Economist<\/em> (which itself struggles with pretension); it had this analysis of the value of philosophy degrees:\r\n<blockquote>Spence himself first used his insight to show why students might choose to pursue a degree in philosophy, which is difficult but does not lead to specific career opportunities, like an economics degree or a marketing degree.  Assume that employers would like to hire smart, diligent workers but can't tell from an interview who is smart or diligent.  Assume also that everyone has to work hard to obtain a philosophy degree, but lazy, dumb people find it particularly troublesome.\r\n\r\nSpence then shows that smart, diligent people can prove they're smart and diligent by going to the trouble of getting a philosophy degree.  It's not that lazy, dumb people can't get that degree but that they wouldn't want to:  employers will pay philosophy graduates enough to compensate them for the trouble but not enough to persuade lazy, dumb people to bother.  The employers are willing to do this despite the fact that the philosophy degree itself does not improve the candidate's productivity at all.  It is merely a credible signal, because a philosophy degree is too much trouble for lazy, dumb people to acquire.<\/blockquote>\r\nIs this an accurate analysis?  A friend of mine was studying for a mid-term in a course called Gemstones and Gemology.  I said, are you really going to get college credit for a course on jewelry?  She came back with, What are you studying?  Aristotle?  What use is that to anybody?  So I bet her that I could take the practice exam she was working on and that Aristotle would help me do better than she did with her three months of lectures and study.\r\n\r\nI took the test.  Not only did I beat my friend's score, I got everything right.  Why?  Aristotle is the foundation of western science.  If you understand Aristotle, you understand how scientific problems are formulated.  In addition, since he started the tradition and his disciples continue it, much of scientific terminology is in Greek or Latin.  I don't have to take a class to tell me what \"anisotropic\" means -- the word itself tells me, and I can guess from it (for example) that stones with anisotropic crystal configurations are opaque.  (This sort of thing is why it's still worth studying Greek*, even for the pragmatically minded.)  Finally, as the founder of syllogistic logic, Aristotle gives insight into contradictions that allow a test-taker to eliminate incorrect options and to see how questions later in the exam illuminate earlier ones.\r\n\r\nThis is a roundabout way of objecting to the assertion that philosophy \"does not improve the candidate's productivity\".  I think philosophy, like mathematics or other problem-solving disciplines, does increase productivity by giving students tools to analyze problems and to accelerate learning.  And I doubt that most students who study philosophy choose the degree to signal diligence and brains to potential employers -- there are more direct ways of doing this, and most philosophy students don't think about future employment at all**.  Being able to do your coursework in the pub is probably a much more important factor.\r\n\r\n*  I was flipping through a book called something like <em>The Smartest Guy in the World<\/em> in an airport bookstore, about someone who read everything he could to be a success on the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.  I put it down when he confessed that the multiple-choice question he missed was, \"What are red blood cells called?\"  One of the answers, erythrocyte, means \"red cell\" in Greek.  Can't be that smart.\r\n\r\n** A friend of mine wrote a comic that I thought was funny at university:  A guy is standing behind a cash register and the customer asks, \"Where's my change?\"  The guy answers, \"True change comes from within.\"  The caption is, \"Why philosophy majors have trouble finding a job.\"",

    "post_content": "With Chinese, I'm still at the rote memorization stage.  I was talking with Manny last night about techniques for learning dialogues by heart, and thinking about the long road from here to fluency.  How do you know when you are fluent in a language?  Many people answer that question by saying, \"When you start dreaming in it.\"  Can that be the right answer?\r\n\r\nI've had dreams in which I can fly, but I don't think that means that I really can fly, or even that I know what it would feel like to be a bird or Superman.  That's part of the magic of dreams, you can have the feeling of doing something without the reality of it.\r\n\r\nI have a stronger reason to doubt the dream hypothesis:  I've dreamt that I could speak Ancient Greek.  After six years of study, I can read Homer and the early Platonic dialogues with not much effort, but I can't *speak* Ancient Greek.  And I had just started studying Greek in a summer intensive program when I had this dream, so I couldn't even read that much without a dictionary.\r\n\r\nI think that dreaming in a language is an indication that you are immersed in the language, but isn't necessarily a sign of fluency.  I also think that you probably gain fluency in different domains more quickly.  Many gaijin are fluent in \"Taxi Japanese\", and can get home from any part of the city, but many of them have no other Japanese language competence.\r\n\r\nI began to suspect that I was gaining general fluency in Japanese the day I got on the train at Shinjuku station, then immediately jumped off when the conductor announced that it would be an express train (which skips my station).  I didn't have time to reflect on or translate the announcement -- I reacted to the words subconsciously.\r\n\r\nIn France, I met an apple farmer during a bike ride to Mont-Saint-Michel.  After some minutes of conversation, he asked if I were Breton.  No one would mistake me for French (there are not many 6'4\" blond Frenchmen), but to be mistaken for the Celtic minority of Bretagne made me realize my studying had paid off.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, a good comeback made me feel like I had reached a degree of fluency in everyday conversation.  I was in the student cafeteria (the Mensa), testing bottles of soda to find a cold one.  I finally took one from the back of the rack, and the server scolded me in German:  \"They are all the same!\"  I said without thinking:  \"Then it doesn't matter which one I take, does it?\"",

I'm planning to spend money as I normally would for the first month, then categorize my expenditures and see what I can reduce (taxi fares!) and what I should increase (books, excursions).\r\n\r\nTwo things are becoming clear:  I spend a lot of money on sweets, and I get shortchanged a lot.  When I say I'm being shortchanged, I mean I'm getting the wrong change from purchases, and that it's never in my favor.  When I say \"a lot\", I meant it has happened three times in the past week (I just started keeping track this month).\r\n\r\nYesterday I didn't get shortchanged, but I got an incorrect bill.  I went to the fish and chips shop around the corner on Endell Street and had cod and chips and a coke.  The bill came back as £25 ($50).  I asked if it was correct, the server said Yes.  I asked him to check again, he said, Oh, I'm sorry, crossed out £25 and wrote £21.  I said, What's 11+3.  He said Sorry again and gave me the revised bill for £14 (the correct amount).  I think it was a genuine mistake, but I never would have noticed if I hadn't been writing my expenses down in my notebook.",

    "post_content": "July 4\/August 1\/August 8\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt least a year ago, I predicted a spike in weddings and Caesarian sections on today's date as people try to arrange a favorable beginning for these events.  I read recently that entrepreneurs in Beijing were capitalizing on the first circumstance by booking wedding halls for August 8, then hiring them out at higher rates to less foresightful couples.  For the second part, I don't know for sure that the number of births will increase, or that anyone has figured out a way to make money from it, but I think it's likely that anyone who was already planning a C-section around this time will go for the 8th, and that some people who weren't planning one for medical reasons will do so anyway.  I base this on the decision of a university friend to arrange 03\/03\/03 as his daughter's birthday via C-section, motivated only by the desire for symmetry.\r\n\r\nOf course the other big event starting out today is the Beijing Olympics.  Put births and the games together and you get this recent headline:  \"Over 3500 children named 'Olympics' in China\".  If \"Porsche\" and \"Mercedes\" are legitimate aspirational names, maybe \"Gold Medal\" should be too.",

I originally pictured Covent Garden as a pennant on the mast of Monmouth Street, but after playing with a few drawings, it seems more appropriate to think of it as a hat, specifically a witch's hat:  its shape is more irregular than the perfect triangle of a pennant, and the \"Covent\" of Covent Garden is perfectly balanced between <em>convent<\/em> (a residence for religious brothers or especially sisters) and <em>coven<\/em> (a congregation of witches).\n\nBoth come from the same Latin word <em>convenire<\/em>, to come together or convene.  The double rectangle of the garden and the Opera House makes a perfect buckle, and imagining a Union Jack patch at the western edge of Shelton Street makes it easy to reconstruct Seven Dials from memory.\n\nHere's the outline in the correct north-south orientation.  I left out most of the internal streets to make the witch hat shape clear.  This drawing fits exactly over the mini A-Z:  I took no artistic license!\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-451\" title=\"coventgarden\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/coventgarden.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/>",

    "post_content": "I was flipping through my London A-Z to check my knowledge of Covent Garden's topography, and King Street, Great Queen Street, and Maiden Lane started to seem like the beginning of a fairy tale.  I looked through the index to see what other stories might be hiding there, and found a Groom Crescent and a full page of Princes for the Maiden.\r\n\r\nMy old address Minerva Street has a Hera Court, an Ares Court, and a Bacchus Walk to keep her company.  I particularly like Bacchus Walk:  I imagine the god of wine stumbling home after a night out, doing the Bacchus Walk.\r\n\r\nI found a Fish Yard, Chip Street, and Vinegar Street, but what to wash them down with?  The abstinent can choose from Tea Trade Wharf or Water Gardens.  And the rest?  The index goes from \"Bee Passage\" to \"Beeston Close\":  No Beer.  No Lager, Stout, or Bitter.  No Pint.  Not to despair:  for the impatient tippler there is a Wine Close.",

    "post_content": "One of my goals for this sabbatical was to absorb some of the pop culture I missed out on while living in Tokyo for so long.  I had planned on renting Heroes, watching the Sopranos through to the finale, and playing some video games.  Manny's pad in Covent Garden has all the important mod cons:  42\" plasma TV, Xbox, Wii <strong>and<\/strong> PS3, so I thought, Why wait?\r\n\r\nWe bought the game on Wednesday and it took until just after midnight to learn to drive, fight, shoot and take the Michelle character out on dates.  On Thursday I played from about 2:00p until I had acquired a set of body armor, a knife, a pistol, a shotgun and a police car about six hours later.  Then we were ready to really start playing.\r\n\r\nMost days we've been up until around 1:00a playing, and that was exercising real discipline.  I'm not sure that playing a violent game like GTA makes you more likely to commit violent acts in real life, but I know that after playing for three solid days it does affect your perception.  In the game, if you beat up or run over a character, any cash he has falls out of his pockets and glows green.  I was walking down Neal Street on Friday and saw a fluorescent green plastic spoon from the local gelato place glowing in the sun on the cobblestones.  My first thought was, \"Ooh, money.\"",

I looked through the index to see what other stories might be hiding there, and found a Groom Crescent and a full page of Princes for the Maiden.\r\n\r\nMy old address Minerva Street has a Hera Court, an Ares Court, and a Bacchus Walk to keep her company.  I particularly like Bacchus Walk:  I imagine the god of wine stumbling home after a night out, doing the Bacchus walk.\r\n\r\nI found a Fish Yard, Chip Street, and Vinegar Street, but what to wash them down with?  The abstinent can choose from Tea Trade Wharf or Water Gardens.  And the rest?  The index goes from \"Bee Passage\" to \"Beeston Close\":  No Beer.  No Lager, Stout, or Bitter.  No Pint.  Not to despair:  for the impatient tippler there is a Wine Close.",

I'm planning to spend money as I normally would for the first month, then categorize my expenditures and see what I can reduce (taxi fares!) and what I should increase (books, excursions).\n\nTwo things are becoming clear:  I spend a lot of money on sweets, and I get shortchanged a lot.  When I say I'm being shortchanged, I mean I'm getting the wrong change from purchases, and that it's never in my favor.  When I say \"a lot\", I meant it has happened three times in the past week (I just started keeping track this month).\n\nYesterday I went to the fish and chips shop around the corner on Endell Street and had cod and chips and a coke.  The bill came back as £25 ($50).  I asked if it was correct, the server said Yes.  I asked him to check again, he said, Oh, I'm sorry, crossed out £25 and wrote £21.  I said, What's 11+3.  He said Sorry again and gave me the revised bill for £14 (the correct amount).  I never would have noticed if I hadn't been writing my expenses down in my notebook -- I will probably be richer if I keep this habit up.",

I originally pictured Covent Garden as a pennant on the mast of Monmouth Street, but after playing with a few drawings, it seems more appropriate to think of it as a hat, specifically a witch's hat:  its shape is more irregular than the perfect triangle of a pennant, and the \"Covent\" of Covent Garden is perfectly balanced between <em>convent<\/em> (a residence for religious brothers or especially sisters) and <em>coven<\/em> (a congregation of witches).\r\n\r\nBoth come from the same Latin word <em>convenire<\/em>, to come together or convene.  The double rectangle of the garden and the Opera House makes a perfect buckle, and imagining a Union Jack patch at the western edge of Shelton Street makes it easy to reconstruct Seven Dials from memory.\r\n\r\nHere's the outline in the correct north-south orientation.  I left out most of the internal streets to make the witch hat shape clear.  This drawing fits exactly over the mini A-Z:  I took no artistic license!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-451\" title=\"coventgarden\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/coventgarden.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/>",

    "post_content": "It to me a while to calculate this, but I figured out that this is my ninth international move and my 42nd move overall.  I'm sure that's higher than average, even in this footloose age.  Luckily, I didn't have to start the reckoning from scratch.  I calculated several years ago that my family had moved 21 times before I turned 17, so I just added the moves from when I left for college (exactly double).\r\n\r\nWhen you move internationally, you fill out reams of forms:  volume estimates, insurance forms, customs forms, powers-of-attorney, and shipping inventories.  All of these forms ask for basically the same information (what you are shipping, what it's worth, where it's going), and each time you move, you start from scratch, even if you are moving basically the same stuff (i.e., you haven't acquired or discarded much).  This sounds like an opportunity for automation!\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Tokyo (two moves before the current one), I bought 28 clear plastic boxes with locking lids and printed out 28 A4 pages with the following information:\r\n<blockquote>Property of Shanghai Bob (bobby.dazzler@shanghaibob.com)\r\nFull contents online at http:\/\/shanghaibob.com\/contents\/\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 90px;\">1<\/h1>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Box 1 of 28<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\nThen I put the pages into plastic slip-covers (more plastic!) underneath the box lids.  The main numbers are one-third the height of the page, easy to see without opening the box.\r\n\r\nI use the numbers as IDs (primary keys) for an online inventory.  Some of the boxes I don't even open from move to move (old photos, archived files, etc.), so I don't have to re-do any of that work.  And if I move the contents of a smaller box to a larger one or vice versa, I just swap the ID pages and repoint the online content listing.  When the movers come, I print out a copy for them and myself, and we use the same file for insurance.\r\n\r\nWhen I store my stuff, I just store the boxes in numerical order.  If I need something, I look the location up on my website.  When I was in the US and my stuff was in storage in the UK, I needed my tux (dinner jacket) for the Christmas party.  I looked online and saw that it was in box 13 -- if only it had been as easy for my UK-based friend to ship it through customs as it was to identify the correct box.\r\n\r\nNormally primary\/surrogate keys don't convey any information, but I took advantage of a few mnemonics:  I put Christmas ornaments in box 25, my old (paper-based!) journals in 17 (my birthday), and my go set (a Japanese board game) in box five (the Japanese word for five is pronounced \"go\").",

    "post_content": "I've been keeping track of my expenses (i.e., recording everything I spend) so I can produce an accurate account at the end of my trip.  I'm planning to spend money as I normally would for the first month, then categorize my expenditures and see what I can reduce (taxi fares!) and what I should increase (books, excursions).\r\n\r\nTwo things are becoming clear:  I spend a lot of money on sweets, and I get shortchanged a lot.  When I say I'm being shortchanged, I mean I'm getting the wrong change from purchases, and that it's never in my favor.  When I say \"a lot\", I meant it has happened three times in the past week (I just started keeping track this month).\r\n\r\nYesterday I didn't get shortchanged, but I got an incorrect bill.  I went to the fish and chips shop around the corner on Endell Street and had cod and chips and a coke.  The bill came back as £25 ($50).  I asked if it was correct, the server said Yes.  I asked him to check again, he said, Oh, I'm sorry, crossed out £25 and wrote £21.  I said, What's 11+3.  He said Sorry again and gave me the revised bill for £14 (the correct amount).  I think it was a genuine mistake, but I never would have noticed if I hadn't been writing my expenses down in my notebook.",

I had planned on renting Heroes, watching the Sopranos through to the finale, and playing some video games.  Manny's pad in Covent Garden has all the important mod cons:  42\" plasma TV, Xbox, Wii <strong>and<\/strong> PS3.  Why wait?\r\n\r\nWe bought Grand Theft Auto IV on Wednesday and it took until just after midnight to learn to drive, fight, shoot and take the Michelle character out on dates.  On Thursday I played from about 2:00p until I had acquired a set of body armor, a knife, a pistol, a shotgun and a police car about six hours later.  Then we were ready to really start playing.\r\n\r\nMost days we've been up until around 1:00a playing, and that was exercising real discipline.  I'm not sure that playing a violent game like GTA makes you more likely to commit violent acts in real life, but I know that after playing for three solid days it does affect your perception.  In the game, if you beat up or run over a character, any cash he has falls out of his pockets and glows green.  I was walking down Neal Street on Friday and saw a fluorescent green plastic spoon from the local gelato place glowing in the sun on the cobblestones.  My first thought was, \"Ooh, money.\"",

    "post_content": "I've been lucky to have a number of good friends who are eager to teach me to say and do things the proper English way.  I've learned to invite my \"mates\" back to my \"gaff\" (invite my homies back to my crib, yo) and to pronounce Bethnal Green like the locals do (Beffnal Green).  Both are good for a laugh, since no one expects an American to talk like that.\r\n\r\nI get lessons from strangers, too.  Today as I was walking through the West End, I stopped by Fortnum and Mason to get a snack to eat in the park.  I settled on a pork pie, and asked the clerk if he could heat it up, to which he replied, \"The pork pie likes to be eaten cold, sir.\"  I thought this was a pleasantly indirect way of telling me how to act (a lesson in itself!).  I said, \"OK, let's do what the pork pie wants.\"",

    "post_content": "St. Leonard's is the \"when I grow rich\" church at the top of Shoreditch High Street, nestled among the strip clubs, council houses and bars, and watching over the gradual accretion of art galleries (including the one I live above) and design stores.  The churchyard is always full of men in long coats sharing bottles, but this looks more and more like a station in their retreat.  As the galleries spread and new businesses like the Days Hotel spring up (bringing understandably bewildered Japanese tourists on package holidays to Hackney Road), the streets are getting busier and less dangerous, and you stand a decent chance now of flagging down a taxi when you need one.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to like about this area, not least the awareness of how quickly it is changing from dangerous to merely \"edgy\":  \"Live East, Die Young\" is a common slogan on hoodies and art student leather jackets; that's not the sort of thing you would wear if \"Murder Mile\" were really still a good description of your neighborhood.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, Manny came by with a van to help me take my things to charity.  On Sunday, I finished my inventory of possessions, and on Monday the movers came and hauled everything away.  It's funny how quickly you can go from being constrained (with furniture, property, and obligations) to being free.  Three days, really.  It's even funnier how much respect you get from other drivers when you're behind the wheel of a big white van -- it looked to Manny and myself like regard for the working man, but maybe it was fear for their paint jobs.\r\n\r\nWhen I was saying my goodbyes, my landlord (an artist and entrepreneur who turned this old handbag factory into a beautiful apartment block) told me, \"The business culture here is aggressive, it goes back to the Angles and the Saxons -- everyone is out for what they can get.  If I were a man your age, I would get out of London and settle somewhere else.\"  I'm not sure if China is going to be any kind of respite from aggressiveness and selfishness, but it will have the advantage of seeming more like a game, since the experience will be filtered through a language and culture that are more foreign to me than the near relation of English.  (What is the American relationship with the British, exactly?  You sometimes hear Brits talk of \"our American cousins\" (when they are being friendly), but I always imagine Britain to be like an uncle -- sometimes literally avuncular, sometimes like the old men in the Monty Python skit who say, \"Back in MY day, our dad used to wake us up four hours before we went to bed, feed us a lump of cold poison, then we had to walk to school barefoot in the snow UPHILL in both directions...kids these days!\")\r\n\r\nThis is some of what I will miss:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Victoria Park, which on Bonfire Night last year hosted one of the best fireworks display I've ever seen (including Edokawa's hanabi)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Broadway Market and the cupcakes (made by a fellow Californian transplant)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Hoxton Square and Curtain Road<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The host of strip clubs within five minutes' walk of my flat (I did intentionally visit every one of them at least once, but I did not spend nearly as much time there as I would have before I lived in Tokyo)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Columbia Road's flower market, and the two restaurants on the east side:  The Sting Ray Globe Cafe and Laxeiro<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Brick Lane and the 24-hour Beigel [sic] Bake<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The outdoor picnic benches at The Vibe Bar<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The vandals\/\"street artists\" who make living in Hackney a kind of treasure hunt:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Banksy<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Eine<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Invader<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The local \"ad-jammer\" whose name I couldn't discover on the web<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/li>\r\n\t<li>New Tayyab's (I guess this is technically in Whitechapel, but it beats all the Bangladeshi places on the more famous Brick Lane by a mile)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Regent's Canal<\/li>\r\n\t<li>All the art galleries<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The accent!

    "post_content": "<img src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/stleonard-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"stleonard\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-470\" \/>\r\nSt. Leonard's is the \"when I grow rich\" church at the top of Shoreditch High Street, nestled among the strip clubs, council houses and bars, and watching over the gradual accretion of art galleries (including the one I live above) and design stores.  The churchyard is always full of men in long coats sharing bottles, but this looks more and more like a station in their retreat.  As the galleries spread and new businesses like the Days Hotel spring up (bringing understandably bewildered Japanese tourists on package holidays to Hackney Road), the streets are getting busier and less dangerous, and you stand a decent chance now of flagging down a taxi when you need one.\r\n<img src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/hackneyroad-202x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"hackneyroad\" width=\"202\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-471\" \/>\r\nThere is a lot to like about this area, not least the awareness of how quickly it is changing from dangerous to merely \"edgy\":  \"Live East, Die Young\" is a common slogan on hoodies and art student leather jackets; that's not the sort of thing you would wear if \"Murder Mile\" were really still a good description of your neighborhood.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, Manny came by with a van to help me take my things to charity.  On Sunday, I finished my inventory of possessions, and on Monday the movers came and hauled everything away.  It's funny how quickly you can go from being constrained (with furniture, property, and obligations) to being free.  Three days, really.  It's even funnier how much respect you get from other drivers when you're behind the wheel of a big white van -- it looked to Manny and myself like regard for the working man, but maybe it was fear for their paint jobs.\r\n\r\nWhen I was saying my goodbyes, my landlord (an artist and entrepreneur who turned this old handbag factory into a beautiful apartment block) told me, \"The business culture here is aggressive, it goes back to the Angles and the Saxons -- everyone is out for what they can get.  If I were a man your age, I would get out of London and settle somewhere else.\"  I'm not sure if China is going to be any kind of respite from aggressiveness and selfishness, but it will have the advantage of seeming more like a game, since the experience will be filtered through a language and culture that are more foreign to me than the near relation of English.  (What is the American relationship with the British, exactly?  You sometimes hear Brits talk of \"our American cousins\" (when they are being friendly), but I always imagine Britain to be like an uncle -- sometimes literally avuncular, sometimes like the old men in the Monty Python skit who say, \"Back in MY day, our dad used to wake us up four hours before we went to bed, feed us a lump of cold poison, then we had to walk to school barefoot in the snow UPHILL in both directions...kids these days!\")\r\n\r\nThis is some of what I will miss:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Victoria Park, which on Bonfire Night last year hosted one of the best fireworks display I've ever seen (including Edokawa's hanabi)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Broadway Market and the cupcakes (made by a fellow Californian transplant)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Hoxton Square and Curtain Road<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The host of strip clubs within five minutes' walk of my flat (I did intentionally visit every one of them at least once, but I did not spend nearly as much time there as I would have before I lived in Tokyo)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Columbia Road's flower market, and the two restaurants on the east side:  The Sting Ray Globe Cafe and Laxeiro<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Brick Lane and the 24-hour Beigel [sic] Bake<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The outdoor picnic benches at The Vibe Bar<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The vandals\/\"street artists\" who make living in Hackney a kind of treasure hunt:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Banksy<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Eine<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Invader<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The local \"ad-jammer\" whose name I couldn't discover on the web<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/li>\r\n\t<li>New Tayyab's (I guess this is technically in Whitechapel, but it beats all the Bangladeshi places on the more famous Brick Lane by a mile)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Regent's Canal<\/li>\r\n\t<li>All the art galleries<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The accent!

The churchyard is always full of men in long coats sharing bottles, but this looks more and more like a station in their retreat.  As the galleries spread and new businesses like the Days Hotel spring up (bringing understandably bewildered Japanese tourists on package holidays to Hackney Road), the streets are getting busier and less dangerous, and you stand a decent chance now of flagging down a taxi when you need one.\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-471\" title=\"hackneyroad\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/hackneyroad-202x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"202\" height=\"300\" \/>\r\nThere is a lot to like about this area, not least the awareness of how quickly it is changing from dangerous to merely \"edgy\":  \"Live East, Die Young\" is a common slogan on hoodies and art student leather jackets; that's not the sort of thing you would wear if \"Murder Mile\" were really still a good description of your neighborhood.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, Manny came by with a van to help me take my things to charity.  On Sunday, I finished my inventory of possessions, and on Monday the movers came and hauled everything away.  It's funny how quickly you can go from being constrained (with furniture, property, and obligations) to being free.  Three days, really.  It's even funnier how much respect you get from other drivers when you're behind the wheel of a big white van -- it looked to Manny and myself like regard for the working man, but maybe it was fear for their paint jobs.\r\n\r\nWhen I was saying my goodbyes, my landlord (an artist and entrepreneur who turned this old handbag factory into a beautiful apartment block) told me, \"The business culture here is aggressive, it goes back to the Angles and the Saxons -- everyone is out for what they can get.  If I were a man your age, I would get out of London and settle somewhere else.\"  I'm not sure if China is going to be any kind of respite from aggressiveness and selfishness, but it will have the advantage of seeming more like a game, since the experience will be filtered through a language and culture that are more foreign to me than the near relation of English.  (What is the American relationship with the British, exactly?  You sometimes hear Brits talk of \"our American cousins\" (when they are being friendly), but I always imagine Britain to be like an uncle -- sometimes literally avuncular, sometimes like the old men in the Monty Python skit who say, \"Back in MY day, our dad used to wake us up four hours before we went to bed, feed us a lump of cold poison, then we had to walk to school barefoot in the snow UPHILL in both directions...kids these days!\")\r\n\r\nThis is some of what I will miss:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Victoria Park, which on Bonfire Night last year hosted one of the best fireworks display I've ever seen (including Edokawa's hanabi)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Broadway Market and the cupcakes (made by a fellow Californian transplant)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Hoxton Square and Curtain Road<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The host of strip clubs within five minutes' walk of my flat (I did intentionally visit every one of them at least once, but I did not spend nearly as much time there as I would have before I lived in Tokyo)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Columbia Road's flower market, and the two restaurants on the east side:  The Sting Ray Globe Cafe and Laxeiro<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Brick Lane and the 24-hour Beigel [sic] Bake<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The outdoor picnic benches at The Vibe Bar<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The vandals\/\"street artists\" who make living in Hackney a kind of treasure hunt:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Banksy<\/li>\r\n\t<li><a title=\"Eine\" href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/boblog\/36-views-of-hackney-eine\/\" target=\"_self\">Eine<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li>Invader<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The local \"ad-jammer\" whose name I couldn't discover on the web<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/li>\r\n\t<li>New Tayyab's (I guess this is technically in Whitechapel, but it beats all the Bangladeshi places on the more famous Brick Lane by a mile)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Regent's Canal<\/li>\r\n\t<li>All the art galleries<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The accent!

As the galleries spread and new businesses like the Days Hotel spring up (bringing understandably bewildered Japanese tourists on package holidays to Hackney Road), the streets are getting busier and less dangerous, and you stand a decent chance now of flagging down a taxi when you need one.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-471\" title=\"hackneyroad\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/hackneyroad-202x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"202\" height=\"300\" \/>\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to like about this area, not least the awareness of how quickly it is changing from dangerous to merely \"edgy\":  \"Live East, Die Young\" is a common slogan on hoodies and art student leather jackets; that's not the sort of thing you would wear if \"Murder Mile\" were really still a good description of your neighborhood.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, Manny came by with a van to help me take my things to charity.  On Sunday, I finished my inventory of possessions, and on Monday the movers came and hauled everything away.  It's funny how quickly you can go from being constrained (with furniture, property, and obligations) to being free.  Three days, really.  It's even funnier how much respect you get from other drivers when you're behind the wheel of a big white van -- it looked to Manny and myself like regard for the working man, but maybe it was fear for their paint jobs.\r\n\r\nWhen I was saying my goodbyes, my landlord (an artist and entrepreneur who turned this old handbag factory into a beautiful apartment block) told me, \"The business culture here is aggressive, it goes back to the Angles and the Saxons -- everyone is out for what they can get.  If I were a man your age, I would get out of London and settle somewhere else.\"  I'm not sure if China is going to be any kind of respite from aggressiveness and selfishness, but it will have the advantage of seeming more like a game, since the experience will be filtered through a language and culture that are more foreign to me than the near relation of English.  (What is the American relationship with the British, exactly?  You sometimes hear Brits talk of \"our American cousins\" (when they are being friendly), but I always imagine Britain to be like an uncle -- sometimes literally avuncular, sometimes like the old men in the Monty Python skit who say, \"Back in MY day, our dad used to wake us up four hours before we went to bed, feed us a lump of cold poison, then we had to walk to school barefoot in the snow UPHILL in both directions...kids these days!\")\r\n\r\nThis is some of what I will miss:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Victoria Park, which on Bonfire Night last year hosted one of the best fireworks display I've ever seen (including Edokawa's hanabi)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Broadway Market and the cupcakes (made by a fellow Californian transplant)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Hoxton Square and Curtain Road<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The host of strip clubs within five minutes' walk of my flat (I did intentionally visit every one of them at least once, but I did not spend nearly as much time there as I would have before I lived in Tokyo)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Columbia Road's flower market, and the two restaurants on the east side:  The Sting Ray Globe Cafe and Laxeiro<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Brick Lane and the 24-hour Beigel [sic] Bake<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The outdoor picnic benches at The Vibe Bar<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The vandals\/\"street artists\" who make living in Hackney a kind of treasure hunt:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/boblog\/36-views-of-hackney-banksy\/\" target=\"_self\">Banksy<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li><a title=\"Eine\" href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/boblog\/36-views-of-hackney-eine\/\" target=\"_self\">Eine<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li>Invader<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The local \"ad-jammer\" whose name I couldn't discover on the web<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/li>\r\n\t<li>New Tayyab's (I guess this is technically in Whitechapel, but it beats all the Bangladeshi places on the more famous Brick Lane by a mile)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Regent's Canal<\/li>\r\n\t<li>All the art galleries<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The accent!

    "post_content": "It to me a while to calculate this, but I figured out that this is my ninth international move and my 42nd move overall.  I'm sure that's higher than average, even in this footloose age.  Luckily, I didn't have to start the reckoning from scratch.  I calculated several years ago that my family had moved 21 times before I turned 17, so I just added the moves from when I left for college (exactly double).\r\n\r\nWhen you move internationally, you fill out reams of forms:  volume estimates, insurance forms, customs forms, powers-of-attorney, and shipping inventories.  All of these forms ask for basically the same information (what you are shipping, what it's worth, where it's going), and each time you move, you start from scratch, even if you are moving basically the same stuff (i.e., you haven't acquired or discarded much).  This sounds like an opportunity for automation!\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Tokyo (two moves before the current one), I bought 28 clear plastic boxes with locking lids and printed out 28 A4 pages with the following information:\r\n<blockquote>Property of Shanghai Bob (bobby.dazzler@shanghaibob.com)\r\nFull contents online at http:\/\/shanghaibob.com\/contents\/\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 90px;\">1<\/h1>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Box 1 of 28<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\nThen I put the pages into plastic slip-covers (more plastic!) underneath the box lids.  The main numbers are one-third the height of the page, easy to see without opening the box.\r\n\r\nI use the numbers as IDs (primary keys) for an online inventory.  Some of the boxes I don't even open from move to move (old photos, archived files, etc.), so I don't have to re-do any of that work.  And if I move the contents of a smaller box to a larger one or vice versa, I just swap the ID pages and repoint the online content listing.  When the movers come, I print out a copy for them and myself, and we use the same file for insurance.\r\n\r\nWhen I store my stuff, I just store the boxes in numerical order.  If I need something, I look the location up on my website.  When I was in the US and my stuff was in storage in the UK, I needed my tux (dinner jacket) for the Christmas party.  I looked online and saw that it was in box 13 -- if only it had been as easy for my UK-based friend to ship it through customs as it was to identify the correct box.\r\n\r\nNormally primary\/surrogate keys don't convey any information, but I took advantage of a few mnemonics:  I put Christmas ornaments in box 25, my old (paper-based!) journals in 17 (my birthday), and my go set (a Japanese board game) in box five (the Japanese word for five is pronounced \"go\").",

    "post_content": "Freiburg for me is \"a mix of old and new,\" not in the sense of the guidebook cliche that is so often applied to fast-developing cities (especially since Freiburg is the opposite of dynamic), but because my experience of Freiburg has such distinct boundaries:  I lived here before I finished college (old), and am back now after over eight years in the working world (new).\r\n\r\nThings I learned in Freiburg:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>German<\/li>\r\n\t<li>How to cook (my friend \"majored\" in cooking, textiles, and French)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>How to play chess (on the outdoor, giant-sized chessboard where every defeat is a public humiliation)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>How to play ping-pong<\/li>\r\n\t<li>How to pronounce <em>Pädagogische Hochschule<\/em>.  I realized later that no one bothered -- they all abbreviate it as \"PH\" (<em>pay-hah<\/em>).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWhat's typical Freiburg:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The river Dreisam (<em>Bist du <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">ein<\/span><\/em><em>sam, gehe <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">zwei<\/span><\/em><em>sam an die <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Drei<\/span><\/em><em>sam:<\/em>  \"If you're lonely, go with a partner to the Dreisam.\")<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Freiburg's \"Bächle\", the little runnels carved in the streets of Freiburg that channel Dreisam water through the city.

For the record, I generally opt for the gelateria.\r\n\r\n<dt><strong>What is the difference between ice cream and gelato?<\/strong><\/dt> <dd>Ice cream is made with cream (no surprise there), while gelato is made with (high fat) milk.  Ice cream freezers are colder than gelato freezers.  Both these things contribute to the difference in texture that is the most notable macro-level distinction between ice cream and gelato.<\/dd>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<dt><strong>What is the difference between lager\/pilsener and ale\/bitter\/porter\/stout.<\/strong><\/dt> <dd>The difference is in the type of yeast used:  lagers use \"bottom-fermenting\" yeast and are fermented at colder temperatures.  Top-fermenting yeast and higher temperatures produce ales and the ale subclasses of bitter, porter, stout, etc.  \r\n\r\n<p>Since yeast is the agent for <a title=\"Define &quot;ester&quot;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=define:+ester\" target=\"_blank\">ester<\/a> and alcohol production, higher temperatures and ale yeast generally produce more complex flavors and more alcohol by volume.\r\n\r\n<\/dd>",

    "post_content": "Since all of my time is currently free time, I've been spending a lot of it in parks and pubs, and \"measuring out my life with coffee spoons\" in cafes.  Sometimes, I get to talk to strangers.\r\n\r\nI was in the Crown and Anchor, writing in my journal, when I noticed a scruffy but pretty girl drinking a beer and reading Bertrand Russell's <em>A History of Western Philosophy<\/em>.  I assumed she was a philosophy student (as I was myself once).  She asked me to watch her stuff for a minute, and when she got back I asked her if she was carrying that heavy tome for self-defense on the mean streets of London, or if it was for a course.  It turns out she's doing a philosophy degree at UCL.\r\n\r\nIt may be that reading technique has declined since I was a student:  hers involved moving her head side-to-side as if she were watching a miniature tennis match taking place on the pages of her book.  I got the impression from this that the book was a little bit for show, and that she was absorbing more Beck's than Bertrand.  Philosophy students weren't pretentious back in my day, oh no.\r\n\r\nFor laughs, I was tempted to ask, \"What are you going to do with a degree in philosophy?\"  I didn't, as I know from experience how annoying that question can be.  Instead, I confessed that I had done a degree in philosophy, followed shortly by another.  I should have added, \"And now I'm unemployed.\"\r\n\r\nI'm reading <em>The Undercover Economist<\/em> (which itself struggles with pretension); it had this analysis of the value of philosophy degrees:\r\n<blockquote>Spence himself first used his insight to show why students might choose to pursue a degree in philosophy, which is difficult but does not lead to specific career opportunities, like an economics degree or a marketing degree.  Assume that employers would like to hire smart, diligent workers but can't tell from an interview who is smart or diligent.  Assume also that everyone has to work hard to obtain a philosophy degree, but lazy, dumb people find it particularly troublesome.\r\n\r\nSpence then shows that smart, diligent people can prove they're smart and diligent by going to the trouble of getting a philosophy degree.  It's not that lazy, dumb people can't get that degree but that they wouldn't want to:  employers will pay philosophy graduates enough to compensate them for the trouble but not enough to persuade lazy, dumb people to bother.  The employers are willing to do this despite the fact that the philosophy degree itself does not improve the candidate's productivity at all.  It is merely a credible signal, because a philosophy degree is too much trouble for lazy, dumb people to acquire.<\/blockquote>\r\nIs this an accurate analysis?  A friend of mine was studying for a mid-term in a course called Gemstones and Gemology.  I said, are you really going to get college credit for a course on jewelry?  She came back with, What are you studying?  Aristotle?  What use is that to anybody?  So I bet her that I could take the practice exam she was working on and that Aristotle would help me do better than she did with her three months of lectures and study.\r\n\r\nI took the test.  Not only did I beat my friend's score, I got everything right.  Why?  Aristotle is the foundation of western science.  If you understand Aristotle, you understand how scientific problems are formulated.  In addition, since he started the tradition and his disciples continue it, much of scientific terminology is in Greek or Latin.  I don't have to take a class to tell me what \"anisotropic\" means -- the word itself tells me, and I can guess from it (for example) that stones with anisotropic crystal configurations are opaque.  (This sort of thing is why it's still worth studying Greek*, even for the pragmatically minded.)  Finally, as the founder of syllogistic logic, Aristotle gives insight into contradictions that allow a test-taker to eliminate incorrect options and to see how questions later in the exam illuminate earlier ones.\r\n\r\nThis is a roundabout way of objecting to the assertion that philosophy \"does not improve the candidate's productivity\".  I think philosophy, like mathematics or other problem-solving disciplines, does increase productivity by giving students tools to analyze problems and to accelerate learning.  And I doubt that most students who study philosophy choose the degree to signal diligence and brains to potential employers -- there are more direct ways of doing this, and most philosophy students don't think about future employment at all**.  Being able to do your coursework in the pub is probably a much more important factor.\r\n\r\n*  I was flipping through a book called something like <em>The Smartest Guy in the World<\/em> in an airport bookstore, about someone who read everything he could to be a success on the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.  I put it down when he confessed that the multiple-choice question he missed was, \"What are red blood cells called?\"  One of the answers, erythrocyte, means \"red cell\" in Greek.  Can't be that smart.\r\n\r\n** A friend of mine wrote a comic that I thought was funny at university:  A guy is standing behind a cash register and the customer asks, \"Where's my change?\"  The guy answers, \"True change comes from within.\"  The caption is, \"Why philosophy majors have trouble finding a job.\"",

    "post_content": "Since all of my time is currently free time, I've been spending a lot of it in parks and pubs, and \"measuring out my life with coffee spoons\" in cafes.  Sometimes, I get to talk to strangers.\n\nI was in the Crown and Anchor, writing in my journal, when I noticed a scruffy but pretty girl drinking a beer and reading Bertrand Russell's <em>A History of Western Philosophy<\/em>.  I assumed she was a philosophy student (as I was myself once).  She asked me to watch her stuff for a minute, and when she got back I asked her if she was carrying that heavy tome for self-defense on the mean streets of London, or if it was for a course.  It turns out she's doing a philosophy degree at UCL.\n\nIt may be that reading technique has declined since I was a student:  hers involved moving her head side-to-side as if she were watching a miniature tennis match taking place on the pages of her book.  I got the impression from this that the book was a little bit for show, and that she was absorbing more Beck's than Bertrand.  Philosophy students weren't pretentious back in my day, oh no.\n\nFor laughs, I was tempted to ask, \"What are you going to do with a degree in philosophy?\"  I didn't, as I know from experience how annoying that question can be.  Instead, I confessed that I had done a degree in philosophy, followed shortly by another.  I should have added, \"And now I'm unemployed.\"\n\nI'm reading <em>The Undercover Economist<\/em> (which itself struggles with pretension); it had this analysis of the value of philosophy degrees:\n<blockquote>Spence himself first used his insight to show why students might choose to pursue a degree in philosophy, which is difficult but does not lead to specific career opportunities, like an economics degree or a marketing degree.  Assume that employers would like to hire smart, diligent workers but can't tell from an interview who is smart or diligent.  Assume also that everyone has to work hard to obtain a philosophy degree, but lazy, dumb people find it particularly troublesome.\n\nSpence then shows that smart, diligent people can prove they're smart and diligent by going to the trouble of getting a philosophy degree.  It's not that lazy, dumb people can't get that degree but that they wouldn't want to:  employers will pay philosophy graduates enough to compensate them for the trouble but not enough to persuade lazy, dumb people to bother.  The employers are willing to do this despite the fact that the philosophy degree itself does not improve the candidate's productivity at all.  It is merely a credible signal, because a philosophy degree is too much trouble for lazy, dumb people to acquire.<\/blockquote>\nIs this an accurate analysis?  A friend of mine was studying for a mid-term in a course called Gemstones and Gemology.  I said, \"Are you really going to get college credit for a course on jewelry?\"  She came back with, \"What are you studying?  Aristotle?  What use is that to anybody?\"  So I bet her that I could take the practice exam she was working on and that Aristotle would help me do better than she had after three months of lectures on the subject.\n\nI took the test.  Not only did I beat my friend's score, I got everything right.  Why?  Aristotle is the foundation of western science.  If you understand Aristotle, you understand how scientific problems are formulated.  In addition, since he started the tradition and his disciples continue it, much of scientific terminology is in Greek or Latin.  I don't have to take a class to tell me what \"anisotropic\" means -- the word itself tells me, and I can guess from it (for example) that anisotropic gems split light in different directions.  (This sort of thing is why it's still worth studying Greek*, even for the pragmatically minded.)  Finally, as the founder of syllogistic logic, Aristotle gives insight into contradictions that allow a test-taker to eliminate incorrect options and to see how questions later in the exam illuminate earlier ones.\n\nThis is a roundabout way of objecting to the assertion that philosophy \"does not improve the candidate's productivity\".  I think philosophy, like mathematics or other problem-solving disciplines, does increase productivity by giving students tools to analyze problems and to accelerate learning.  And I doubt that most students who study philosophy choose the degree to signal diligence and brains to potential employers -- there are more direct ways of doing this, and most philosophy students don't think about future employment at all**.  Being able to do your coursework in the pub is probably a much more important factor.\n\n*  I was flipping through a book called something like <em>The Smartest Guy in the World<\/em> in an airport bookstore, about someone who read everything he could to be a success on the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.  I put it down when he confessed that the multiple-choice question he missed was, \"What are red blood cells called?\"  One of the answers, <em>erythrocyte<\/em>, means \"red cell\" in Greek.  Can't be that smart.\n\n** A friend of mine wrote a comic that I thought was funny at university:  A guy is standing behind a cash register and the customer asks, \"Where's my change?\"  The guy answers, \"True change comes from within.\"  The caption is, \"Why philosophy majors have trouble finding a job.\"",

    "post_content": "With Chinese, I'm still at the rote memorization stage.  I was talking with Manny last night about techniques for learning dialogues by heart, and thinking about the long road from here to fluency.  How do you know when you are fluent in a language?  Many people answer that question by saying, \"When you start dreaming in it.\"  Can that be the right answer?\r\n\r\nI've had dreams in which I can fly, but I don't think that means that I really can fly, or even that I know what it would feel like to be a bird or Superman.  That's part of the magic of dreams, you can have the feeling of doing something without the reality of it.\r\n\r\nI have a stronger reason to doubt the dream hypothesis:  I've dreamt that I could speak Ancient Greek.  After six years of study, I can read Homer and the early Platonic dialogues with not much effort, but I can't *speak* Ancient Greek.  And I had just started studying Greek in a summer intensive program when I had this dream, so I couldn't even read that much without a dictionary.\r\n\r\nI think that dreaming in a language is an indication that you are immersed in the language, but isn't necessarily a sign of fluency.  I also think that you probably gain fluency in different domains more quickly.  Many gaijin are fluent in \"Taxi Japanese\", and can get home from any part of the city, but many of them have no other Japanese language competence.\r\n\r\nI began to suspect that I was gaining general fluency in Japanese the day I got on the train at Shinjuku station, then immediately jumped off when the conductor announced that it would be an express train (which skips my station).  I didn't have time to reflect on or translate the announcement -- I reacted to the words subconsciously.\r\n\r\nIn France, I met an apple farmer during a bike ride to Mont-Saint-Michel.  After some minutes of conversation, he asked if I were Breton.  No one would mistake me for French (there are not many 6'4\" blond Frenchmen), but to be mistaken for the Celtic minority of Bretagne made me realize my studying had paid off.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, a good comeback made me feel like I had reached a degree of fluency in everyday conversation.  I was in the student cafeteria (the Mensa), testing bottles of soda to find a cold one.  I finally took one from the back of the rack, and the server scolded me in German:  \"They are all the same!\"  I said without thinking:  \"Then it doesn't matter which one I take, does it?\"",

It's a small, charming city, I'll get to see a good friend from my time in Tokyo, and the weather is bound to be nicer than the rain here in London.  (Though it rained heavily last night and today looks like it's going to be very fine.)\r\n\r\nAndy and Mechelle got me a beautiful journal as a going-away present.  The leather smell reminds me of boots and saddles, so it's kind of an invitation to travel as well as a way to record the trip.  I took this picture of it on top of Manny's \"world traveler\" chest, with China in the upper right.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-589\" title=\"journal\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/journal-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/>",

    "post_content": "I was talking with a friend of a friend in Borough Market's Monmouth Cafe before I left, and she mentioned that there is no word for \"guilt\" in Tibetan.\r\n\r\nThat may be, but just because a language doesn't have a single word for a thing is no indication that it doesn't exist in the culture.  Take the Germans.  If you ask a German what the opposite of smile is, most likely he or she will say \"to wrinkle the forehead\" (<em>Die Stirn runzeln<\/em>) or \"to make a sad face\" (<em>Ein trauriges Gesicht machen<\/em>).  Yet (in my experience, not to stereotype) German officials <em>love<\/em> to frown, especially in disapproval.\r\n\r\nMy flight from Heathrow to Frankfurt was delayed by an hour, so I missed my connection to Basel\/Freiburg.  When I got to the Lufthansa desk in Frankfurt, they said the next flight was the following morning at 9:00.  I asked about a train.  [Frown] The clerk called, chatted with someone, put the phone down and told me that the last train was leaving in just ten minutes and suggested I wait until the morning.  I said I wanted to make the train.  [Frown] He hand-wrote a train voucher and put me in the immigration queue.  The first immigration officer told me I was in the wrong line [Frown].  The second immigration officer told me my brand-new replacement passport was invalid [Frown]:  I hadn't signed it.  I ran to the train and handed my voucher to the attendant.  He said, [Frown] \"I don't think we can accept this.\"\r\n\r\nNot having a word for something in your language doesn't mean you don't understand or use the concept.  Germans frown.  Tibetans likely experience guilt.  And though they had to borrow a word for it, Anglo-Saxons definitely take pleasure in the suffering of others.\r\n\r\nAs I spent two of my precious ten minutes before the train left waiting patiently on the escalator behind several elderly travelers with large luggage, a less patient person forced his way up past all of us, smacking the old folks with his laptop case as he went.  When I got to the top of the escalator, I ran down the corridor, with Laptop Guy far ahead.  At the track flyover, I saw the sign and stairs for Track 5 hidden on the left.  He had gone straight.  I considered calling out to him, but I didn't.  I went left down the stairs and on to the train just 30 seconds before it left.  As the train pulled out I smiled with Schadenfreude, then immediately felt guilty.",

They get a tax break through not having to purchase the standard restaurant license.  The portions were huge, I could only eat half of what I ordered, and since pumpkins are in season there were a lot of pumpkin dishes on the specials board, including a delicious pumpkin soup.\r\n\r\nOn the way out we saw some little kids who had set up a stand to sell grapes, one kilo for 1.80 euros, but they only had one kilo.  I thought it would be a good idea to encourage these miniature entrepreneurs, so I handed over a two-euro coin.\r\n\r\nThe kids were clearly running a just-in-time operation.  As soon as the coin changed hands, four kids took off in different directions, one returning shortly with a new plastic bucket, and two returning with a new bunch of grapes (from where? the neighboring vineyard?).  The coin went into their piggy bank, which differs from a cash register in that it's built not to give anything back until you smash it open.

    "post_content": "Today I read Kate Fox's book <em>Watching the English<\/em>.  It's an anthropological investigation of English cultural \"rules\" that I should have read before arriving, but couldn't get through amazon.com in the US.\r\n\r\nI read this passage yesterday:\r\n<blockquote>Port must always travel round the table clockwise...so you must always pass the bottle or decanter to your left.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nNo-one has the slightest idea why clockwise port-passing is so important.  The rule serves no discernible purpose, other than to cause embarrassment to those who are not aware of it, and, presumably, a peculiarly English sense of smug self-satisfaction among those who are.<\/blockquote>\r\nI loved this book, and wish I had found a copy much earlier than my penultimate day in London.  But the last paragraph stuck in my head as \"wrong\", and while I was packing the reason came to me:  <em>port<\/em> means \"left\" in naval jargon.  I think the rule of passing port clockwise\/to the left is likely in deference to all the party-going naval officers waiting to make a joke about how unnatural it is to pass something called \"port\" to starboard.\r\n\r\nI did a google search to test this theory.  I didn't find direct evidence, but found the phrase \"port to port\", which suggests it is a reasonable assumption.",

He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him; or the old laws be expanded, and interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense, and he will live with the license of a higher order of beings.<\/span><\/p>",

As soon as the coin changed hands, four kids took off in different directions, one returning shortly with a new plastic bucket, and two returning with a new bunch of grapes (from where? the neighboring vineyard?).

    "post_content": "One of the first poems I memorized in German was <em>Die Lorelei<\/em>, which contains the line <em>Und ruhig fließt der Rhein<\/em> (\"and peacefully flows the Rhein\").  It's useful as a reminder that the Rhein, like the Neckar and unlike most other rivers in Germany, is masculine.  But the poem is self-descriptive, in that once you get it stuck in your head, the sing-songy rhythm stays there (<em>das kommt mir nicht aus dem Sinn<\/em>).  It started up when I went for a walk along the banks of the Rhein in Düsseldorf, and got stuck for a good three days.\r\n\r\nThere is at least one place where the Rhein doesn't flow peacefully, however, and we got to see it on Sunday.  On the way back through Switzerland, we drove to Neuhausen to see the Rheinfall.  They've built decks right on top of the flow of water, so you can lean over the edge and get a feeling of what it would be like to jump in.  The falls are not very high (in spite of being the largest waterfall in Europe), but a huge volume of water passes through, 463 cubic meters\/second on the day we were there, which is only one-third of peak flow.  We were lucky that the sun came out long enough to give us a rainbow.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[pictures coming!]<\/p>\r\n\r\nThere's a castle above the viewing decks that you can't really see except from the other side of the river.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-821 aligncenter\" title=\"rheinfaelle\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/rheinfaelle-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/p>",

Three sentences convey the right amount of detail to have a chance of making it into long-term memory, and they take the right amount of \"conversational time\":  people often ask a question not because they want information, but because they want to introduce a topic, share some free-association the topic inspired, talk about their own experience related to the topic, or warm up to the \"real\" question they wanted to ask.  Making a short answer yields the floor back over to them so they can embroider on the topic they've introduced.\r\n\r\nThe three-sentence rule was extremely effective:  conversations with newcomers to Japan on the idiosyncrasies of Japanese food, culture, dating and the rest were suddenly much less like school and much more lively, and the success of the rule gave me some insight into PowerPoint culture:  PowerPoint presentations are not meant to provide detail on a subject.  They are meant to give your audience the three bullet points they need to explain a topic conversationally and yield the floor back to their interlocutor without having to say, \"I don't know.\"",

    "post_content": "Although I've dropped out of working life for the moment, I still spend time online almost every day (not just updating this blog!).  My online life is made more interesting and effective by the German keyboard.\r\n\r\nThis bit of gibberish:\r\n<blockquote>siteÖwikipedia Äqwerty kezboardÄ<\/blockquote>\r\nIs what you get as an American touch-typist pounding out the following google search:\r\n<blockquote>site:wikipedia \"qwerty keyboard\"<\/blockquote>\r\nAfter a few weeks in London, I got used to most of the English keyboard's quirks.  These consist mainly of swapping @ and \", and adding the £ key where Americans are used to the #.  One quirk shared by the English and German keyboards is the slightly larger Enter key that has metastasized to engulf the forward slash+pipe key.  *NIX users typing something like \"rmdir .\/tmp\/old_files\/\" tend to panic when the first forward slash is accidentally converted into an execute.\r\n\r\nBut the German keyboard seems slightly more unfriendly to the average internet user than the American or British keyboard setup.  The @ symbol, for example, is written with right-alt+q, which is fairly inconvenient for something you type frequently in email, and the forward slash is in the number range, a little out of reach.  These criticisms might be unfair:  If email address protocol had been developed by someone working on a German keyboard, the @ might have been replaced with something more readily to hand, like ä, which you don't even need the shift key to produce on a <a title=\"Qwertz keyboard\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/QWERTZ\" target=\"_blank\">Qwertz<\/a> keyboard.\r\n\r\nBut the most troublesome difference is the smallest one, namely the swapping of the y and z keys.  It not only requires a kind of double-think each time you want to type one of those characters, but because Undo is mapped to Ctl-z, when you get something wrong, your attempt to Undo it gets translated into Repeat.",

    "post_content": "In at least one Amazonian language, pitch conveys much of the meaning of an expression, which makes it possible to whistle anything you want to say.  As a result, Pirahã speakers can with little effort hold whistled conversations with people whom they can't see.\r\n\r\nI found this idea fascinating and bizzare, but a little reflection turned up a few examples in English where most of the meaning is encoded in pitch.  For example, if you say, \"I don't know' without opening your mouth or moving your tongue (try it), the low-high-low pitch pattern alone conveys the meaning to other English speakers.\r\n\r\nBut not to speakers of other languages.  When I first moved to France to study, I would occasionally, unconsciously substitute \"uh-huh\" and \"huh-uh\" for <em>Yes <\/em>and <em>No<\/em>.  Because the \"h\" phoneme is not significant in French, French speakers who had not learned English had trouble differentiating the two grunts, and I had to unlearn them.\r\n<blockquote>Yes = uh-huh, mm-hmm\r\nNo = huh-uh, nuh-uh, hm-mm (first \"m\" is actually a glottal stop)<\/blockquote>\r\nIf you add pitch to the mix, you can say \"no way\":  \"say\" <em>huh-uh<\/em>, but extend the final <em>uh<\/em> and give it a falling tone.\r\n\r\nAll this is a long prelude to explain a linguistic discovery a friend and I made some time ago.  German and French both have a word that is a combination of contradiction + assertion.  In English, you need to use a circumlocution.  An example should make it clear:\r\n\r\n \r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You didn't pay the telephone bill, did you?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I did too.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n \r\n\r\nIn English you say, <em>I did too<\/em>, <em>I did so<\/em>, or <em>Yes, I did<\/em>, but in German you can say simply <em>Doch<\/em> (In French it is <em>Si<\/em>.)  Why doesn't English have a one word equivalent for contradicting people?  It turns out that it does, but most people stop using it once they are out of their teens (if they ever use it at all).  To the list of meaningful grunts in English, you can add <em>yeah-huh<\/em> (or <em>yuh-huh<\/em>), which means <em>Yes, so<\/em>.  Pitch is expressive here as well:  the more pitch variation you apply to the \"huh\" syllable, the more obviously wrong you imply your interlocutor is.",

When I first moved to France to study, I would occasionally, unconsciously substitute \"uh-huh\" and \"huh-uh\" for <em>Yes <\/em>and <em>No<\/em>.

Three sentences convey the right amount of detail to have a chance of making it into long-term memory, and they take the right amount of \"conversational time\":  people often ask a question not because they want information, but because they want to introduce a topic, share some free-association the topic inspired, talk about their own experience related to the topic, or warm up to the \"real\" question they wanted to ask.  Making a short answer yields the floor back over to them so they can embroider on the topic they've introduced.\r\n\r\nThe three-sentence rule was extremely effective:  conversations with newcomers to Japan on the idiosyncracies of Japanese food, culture, dating and the rest were suddenly much less like school and much more lively, and the success of the rule gave me some insight into PowerPoint culture.  PowerPoint presentations are not meant to provide detail on a subject.  They are meant to give your audience the three bullet points they need to explain a topic conversationally and yield the floor back to their interlocutor without having to say, \"I don't know.\"",

    "post_content": "The London weather apparently tracked me down and we had a solid 24 hours of rain, which I spent as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>sleeping<\/li>\r\n\t<li>visiting Freiburg's museum of early- and pre-history in the lovely Colombischlössle<\/li>\r\n\t<li>eating at Lorenz Straußi in Kirchhofen<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nA Straußi is a kind of restaurant that produces everything it serves itself or sources it from the neighborhood.  They get a tax break through not having to purchase the standard restaurant license.  The portions were huge, I could only eat half of what I ordered.  Since pumpkins are in season, there were a lot of pumpkin dishes on the specials board, including a delicious pumpkin soup.\r\n\r\nOn the way out we saw some little kids who had set up a stand to sell grapes, one kilo for 1.80 euros, but they only had one kilo.  I thought it would be a good idea to encourage these miniature entrepreneurs, so I handed over a two-euro coin.\r\n\r\nThe kids were clearly running a just-in-time operation.  As soon as the coin changed hands, four kids took off in different directions, one returning shortly with a new plastic bucket, and two returning with a new bunch of grapes (from where? the neighboring vineyard?).  The coin went into their piggy bank, which differs from a cash register in that it's built not to give anything back until you smash it open.

    "post_content": "Although I've dropped out of working life for the moment, I still spend time online almost every day (not just updating this blog!).  My online life is made more interesting and effective by the German keyboard.\r\n\r\nThis bit of gibberish:\r\n<blockquote>siteÖwikipedia Äqwertz kezboardÄ<\/blockquote>\r\nIs what you get as an American touch-typist pounding out the following google search:\r\n<blockquote>site:wikipedia \"qwerty keyboard\"<\/blockquote>\r\nAfter a few weeks in London, I got used to most of the English keyboard's quirks.  These consist mainly of swapping @ and \", and adding the £ key where Americans are used to the #.  One quirk shared by the English and German keyboards is the slightly larger Enter key that has metastasized to engulf the forward slash+pipe key.  *NIX users typing something like \"rmdir .\/tmp\/old_files\/\" tend to panic when the first forward slash is accidentally converted into an execute.\r\n\r\nBut the German keyboard seems slightly more unfriendly to the average internet user than the American or British keyboard setup.  The @ symbol, for example, is written with right-alt+q, which is fairly inconvenient for something you type frequently in email, and the forward slash is in the number range, a little out of reach.  These criticisms might be unfair:  If email address protocol had been developed by someone working on a German keyboard, the @ might have been replaced with something more readily to hand, like ä, which you don't even need the shift key to produce on a <a title=\"Qwertz keyboard\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/QWERTZ\" target=\"_blank\">Qwertz<\/a> keyboard.\r\n\r\nBut the most troublesome difference is the smallest one, namely the swapping of the y and z keys.  It not only requires a kind of double-think each time you want to type one of those characters, but because Undo is mapped to Ctl-z, when you get something wrong, your attempt to Undo it gets translated into Repeat.",

As a result, Pirahã speakers can with little effort hold whistled conversations with people whom they can't see.\r\n\r\nI found this idea fascinating and bizzare, but a little reflection turned up a few examples in English where most of the meaning is encoded in pitch.  For example, if you say, \"I don't know' without opening your mouth or moving your tonge (try it), the low-high-low pitch pattern alone conveys the meaning to other English speakers.\r\n\r\nBut not to speakers of other languages.  When I first moved to France to study, I would occasionally, unconsciously substitute \"uh-huh\" and \"huh-uh\" for <em>Yes <\/em>and <em>No<\/em>.

Why doesn't English have a one word equivalent for contradicting people?  It turns out that it does, but most people stop using it once they are out of their teens (if they ever use it at all).  To the list of meaningful grunts in English, you can add <em>yeah-huh<\/em> (or <em>yuh-huh<\/em>), which means <em>Yes, so<\/em>.

    "post_content": "When I was living in Tokyo, I created a conversational rule for myself:  if someone asked a question and I couldn't answer it in three sentences or less, I would say, \"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nAfter three sentences, people's eyes glaze over -- they weren't really <em>that<\/em> interested in the first place, they are in conversational mode, so not ready to absorb a lot of detail, etc.  And \"I don't know\" is a particularly good answer, since it can't be misinterpreted the way, for example, \"It would take too long to explain\" is usually interpreted as a request to be cajoled.\r\n\r\nThe end result wasn't that I ened up saying \"I don't know\" a lot, though, it was that I got better at explaining things in three sentences.  Three sentences convey the right amount of detail to have a chance of making it into long-term memory, and they take the right amount of \"conversational time\":  people often ask a question not because they want information, but because they want to introduce a topic, share some free-association the topic inspired, talk about their own experience related to the topic, or warm up to the \"real\" question they wanted to ask.  Making a short answer yields the floor back over to them so they can embroider on the topic they've introduced.\r\n\r\nThe three-sentence rule was extremely effective:  conversations with newcomers to Japan on the idiosyncracies of Japanese food, culture, dating and the rest were suddenly much less like school and much more lively, and the success of the rule gave me some insight into PowerPoint culture.  PowerPoint presentations are not meant to provide detail on a subject.  They are meant to give your audience the three bullet points they need to explain a topic conversationally and yield the floor back to their interlocutor without having to say, \"I don't know.\"",

I finished some paperwork in the morning, and so was able to play a couple of hours of ping-pong in the afternoon with a clear conscience.  After our warm-up, I lost four games in a row because, well, I hadn't played for years, I decided to change my grip that day, the sun was in my eyes...\r\n\r\nThe two Meli's joined us for dinner afterward (I cooked, but it was good anyway), then we drove through woods that looked like something out of The Blair Witch Project up the side of a mountain to a Lindy Hop dance.  There were a fair number of people there, the music was good, and it was cool to see the lights of Freiburg twinkling in the valley to one side of the dance floor.",

    "post_content": "When I was living in Tokyo, I created a conversational rule for myself:  if someone asked a question and I couldn't answer it in three sentences or less, I would say, \"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nAfter three sentences, people's eyes glaze over -- they weren't really <em>that<\/em> interested in the first place, they are in conversational mode, so not ready to absorb a lot of detail, etc.  And \"I don't know\" is a particularly good answer, since it can't be misinterpreted the way, for example, \"It would take too long to explain\" is usually interpreted as a request to be cajoled.\r\n\r\nThe end result wasn't that I ened up saying \"I don't know\" a lot, though, it was that I got better at explaining things in three sentences.  Three sentences convey the right amount of detail to have a chance of making it into long-term memory, and they take the right amount of \"conversational time\":  people often ask a question not because they want information, but because they want to introduce a topic, share some free-association the topic inspired, talk about their own experience related to the topic, or warm up to the \"real\" question they wanted to ask.

    "post_content": "When I was living in Tokyo, I created a conversational rule for myself:  if someone asked a question and I couldn't answer it in three sentences or less, I would say, \"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nAfter three sentences, people's eyes glaze over -- they weren't really <em>that<\/em> interested in the first place, they are in conversational mode, so not ready to absorb a lot of detail, etc.  And \"I don't know\" is a particularly good answer, since it can't be misinterpreted the way, for example, \"It would take too long to explain\" is usually interpreted as a request to be cajoled.\r\n\r\nThe end result wasn't that I ended up saying \"I don't know\" a lot, though, it was that I got better at explaining things in three sentences.  Three sentences convey the right amount of detail to have a chance of making it into long-term memory, and they take the right amount of \"conversational time\":  people often ask a question not because they want information, but because they want to introduce a topic, share some free-association the topic inspired, talk about their own experience related to the topic, or warm up to the \"real\" question they wanted to ask.  Making a short answer yields the floor back over to them so they can embroider on the topic they've introduced.\r\n\r\nThe three-sentence rule was extremely effective:  conversations with newcomers to Japan on the idiosyncracies of Japanese food, culture, dating and the rest were suddenly much less like school and much more lively, and the success of the rule gave me some insight into PowerPoint culture.

Since pumpkins are in season, there were a lot of pumpkin dishes on the specials board, including a delicious pumpkin soup.\r\n\r\nOn the way out we saw some little kids who had set up a stand to sell grapes, one kilo for 1.80 euros, but they only had one kilo.  I thought it would be a good idea to encourage these miniature entrepreneurs, so I handed over a two-euro coin.\r\n\r\nThe kids were clearly running a just-in-time operation.  As soon as the coin changed hands, four kids took off in different directions, one returning shortly with a new plastic bucket, and two returning with a new bunch of grapes (from where? the neighboring vineyard?).  The coin went into their piggy bank, which differs from a cash register in that it's built not to give anything back until you smash it open.

    "post_content": "Freiburg for me is \"a mix of old and new,\" not in the sense of the guidebook cliche that is so often applied to fast-developing cities (especially since Freiburg is the opposit of dynamic=), but because my experience of Freiburg has such distinct boundaries:  I lived here before I finished college, and am back now after over eight years in the working world.\r\n\r\nThings I learned in Freiburg:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>German<\/li>\r\n\t<li>How to cooking (my friend \"majored\" in cooking, textiles, and French)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>How to play chess (on the outdoor, giant-sized chessboards where every defeat is a public humiliation)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>How to play ping-pong<\/li>\r\n\t<li>How to pronounce <em>Pädagogische Hochschule<\/em> (where my friends studied).  I realized later that no one bothered -- they all abbreviate it as \"PH\" (<em>pay-hah<\/em>).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWhat's typical Freiburg:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The river Dreisam (<em>Bist du einsam, gehe zweisam an die Dreisam:<\/em>  \"If you're lonely, go with a partner to the Dreisam.\")<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Freiburg's \"Bächle\", the little runnels carved in the streets of Freiburg that channel Dreisam water through the city.  Local legend says that if you step in one accidentally, you'll marry a Freiburger(in).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The Münster.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/boblog\/what-is-the-difference-between\/\" target=\"_self\">What's the difference between a cathedral (Dom) and a minster (Münster)<\/a>?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Spätzle<\/li>\r\n\t<li>People saying it's the warmest city in Germany<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Green-ness, in both senses of the word:  it's a very eco-friendly city, and is literally green.  The city covers the streetcar tracks with sod, and cultivates ivy to grow to cover the electricity poles so that even the infrastructure blends in with the Schwarzwald.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>None of these things is particular to Freiburg, but I got hooked on them here:  banana juice, Happy Cola, Ritter Sport chocolate<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<div>I arrived in the middle of the night after <a title=\"Tibetan has no word for &quot;guilt&quot;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/boblog\/tibetan-has-no-word-for-guilt\/\" target=\"_self\">my flight was delayed<\/a>, but just the Freiburg license plates were enough to trigger old memories.  Cars here have plates that indicate where they were registered, so you can use those letters to indicate your destination when traveling (and exert subtle pressure on people to give you a ride, since it's clear when they are going in your direction).  Somewhere in my storage boxes is a piece of cardboard with TÜ on one side and FR on the other that I used to hitchhike between Tübingen and Freiburg when I was at university.<\/div>",

    "post_content": "When I was living in Tokyo, I created a conversational rule for myself:  if someone asked a question and I couldn't answer it in three sentences or less, I would say, \"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nAfter three sentences, people's eyes glaze over -- they weren't really <em>that<\/em> interested in the first place, they are in conversational mode, so not ready to absorb a lot of detail, etc.  And \"I don't know\" is a particularly good answer, since it can't be misinterpreted the way, for example, \"It would take too long to explain\" is usually interpreted as a request to be cajoled.\r\n\r\nThe end result wasn't that I ended up saying \"I don't know\" a lot, though, it was that I got better at explaining things in three sentences.  Three sentences convey the right amount of detail to have a chance of making it into long-term memory, and they take the right amount of \"conversational time\":  people often ask a question not because they want information, but because they want to introduce a topic, share some free-association the topic inspired, talk about their own experience related to the topic, or warm up to the \"real\" question they wanted to ask.  Making a short answer yields the floor back over to them so they can embroider on the topic they've introduced.\r\n\r\nThe three-sentence rule was extremely effective:  conversations with newcomers to Japan on the idiosyncrasies of Japanese food, culture, dating and the rest were suddenly much less like school and much more lively, and the success of the rule gave me some insight into PowerPoint culture:  PowerPoint presentations are not meant to provide detail on a subject.  They are meant to give your audience the three bullet points they need to explain a topic conversationally and yield the floor back to their interlocutor without having to say, \"I don't know.\"",

    "post_content": "Over the weekend I did several small things on my own in Chinese:  mainly asking for directions and directing taxis.  The exchanges were painless, and a big improvement over my attempts to navigate the city in my first two weeks.  The early attempts usually involved getting the hotel concierge to write my destination on a card in Chinese.\r\n\r\nI have several pages of notes on directions in Chinese, both cardinal directions (north, south, etc.) and taxi directions (left, right, stop here, you are going the wrong way).  The minimum fare in a Shanghai taxi costs only $2.00 and will take you all the way across town, so it's pretty cheap to practice.\r\n\r\nI learned yesterday that Chinese say \"Cold hands, warm heart\" just like we do.  Considering the telegraphic syntax, it could be originally Chinese.  This is just a way of saying that it's still cold here, in spite of today's sunny weather (the first sunny day in three weeks).",

    "post_content": "In at least one Amazonian language, pitch conveys much of the meaning of an expression, which makes it possible to whistle anything you want to say.  As a result, Pirahã speakers can with little effort hold whistled conversations with people whom they can't see.\n\nI found this idea fascinating and bizzare, but a little reflection turned up a few examples in English where most of the meaning is encoded in pitch.  For example, if you say, \"I don't know' without opening your mouth or moving your tonge (try it), the low-high-low pitch pattern alone conveys the meaning to other English speakers.\n\nBut not to speakers of other languages.  When I first moved to France to study, I would occasionally, unconsciously substitute \"uh-huh\" and \"huh-uh\" for <em>Yes <\/em>and <em>No<\/em>.  Because the \"h\" phoneme is not significant in French, French speakers who had not learned English had trouble differentiating the two grunts, and I had to unlearn them.\n<blockquote>Yes = uh-huh, mm-hmm\nNo = huh-uh, nuh-uh, hm-mm (first \"m\" is actually a glottal stop)<\/blockquote>\nIf you add pitch to the mix, you can say \"no way\":  \"say\" <em>huh-uh<\/em>, but extend the final <em>uh<\/em> and give it a falling tone.\n\nAll this is a long prelude to explain a linguistic discovery a friend and I made some time ago.  German and French both have a word that is a combination of contradiction + assertion.  In English, you need to use a circumlocution.  An example should make it clear:\n\n \n<ul>\n\t<li>You didn't pay the telephone bill, did you?<\/li>\n\t<li>I did too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n \n\nIn English you say, <em>I did too<\/em>, <em>I did so<\/em>, or <em>Yes, I did<\/em>, but in German you can say simply <em>Doch<\/em> (In French it is <em>Si<\/em>.)  Why doesn't English have a one word equivalent for contradicting people?  It turns out that it does, but most people stop using it once they are out of their teens (if they ever use it at all).  To the list of meaningful grunts in English, you can add <em>yeah-huh<\/em> (or <em>yuh-huh<\/em>), which means <em>Yes, so<\/em>.  Pitch is expressive here as well:  the more pitch variation you apply to the \"huh\" syllable, the more obviously wrong you imply your interlocutor is.",

If you ask a German what the opposite of smile is, most likely he or she will say \"to wrinkle the forehead\" (<em>Die Stirn runzeln<\/em>) or \"to make a sad face\" (<em>Ein trauriges Gesicht machen<\/em>).  Yet Germans <em>love<\/em> to frown, especially in disapproval.\r\n\r\nMy flight from Heathrow to Frankfurt was delayed by an hour, so I missed my connection to Basel\/Freiburg.  When I got to the Lufthansa desk in Frankfurt, they said the next flight was the following morning at 9:00.  I asked about a train.  [Frown] The clerk called, chatted with someone, put the phone down and told me that the last train was leaving in just ten minutes and suggested I wait until the morning.  I said I wanted to make the train.  [Frown] He hand-wrote a train voucher and put me in the immigration queue.  The first immigration officer told me I was in the wrong line [Frown].  The second immigration officer told me my brand-new replacement passport was invalid [Frown]:  I hadn't signed it.  I ran to the train and handed my voucher to the attendant.  He said, [Frown] \"I don't think we can accept this.\"\r\n\r\nNot having a word for something in your language doesn't mean you don't understand or use the concept.  Germans frown.  Tibetans likely experience guilt.  And though they had to borrow a word for it, Anglo-Saxons definitely take pleasure in the suffering of others.\r\n\r\nAs I spent two of my precious ten minutes before the train left waiting patiently on the escalator behind several elderly travelers with large luggage, a less patient person forced his way up past all of us, smacking the old folks with his laptop case as he went.  When I got to the top of the escalator, I ran down the corridor, with Laptop Guy far ahead.  At the track flyover, I saw the sign and stairs for Track 5 hidden on the left.  Laptop Guy had gone straight.  I considered calling out to him, but I didn't.  I went left down the stairs and on to the train just 30 seconds before it left.  As the train pulled out I felt a thrill of Schadenfreude, smiled, then immediately felt guilty.",

    "post_content": "The London weather apparently tracked me down and we had a solid 24 hours of rain, which I spent as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>sleeping<\/li>\r\n\t<li>visiting Freiburg's museum of early- and pre-history in the lovely Colombischlössle<\/li>\r\n\t<li>eating at Lorenz Straußi in Kirchhofen<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nA Straußi is a kind of restaurant that produces everything it serves itself or sources it from the neighborhood.  They get a tax break through not having to purchase the standard restaurant license.  The portions were huge, I could only eat half of what I ordered, and since pumpkins are in season there were a lot of pumpkin dishes on the specials board, including a delicious pumpkin soup.\r\n\r\nOn the way out we saw some little kids who had set up a stand to sell grapes, one kilo for 1.80 euros, but they only had one kilo.  I thought it would be a good idea to encourage these miniature entrepreneurs, so I handed over a two-euro coin.\r\n\r\nThe kids were clearly running a just-in-time operation.  As soon as the coin changed hands, four kids took off in different directions, one returning shortly with a new plastic bucket, and two returning with a new bunch of grapes (from where? the neighboring vineyard?).  The coin went into their piggy bank, which differs from a cash register in that it's built not to give anything back until you smash it open.

    "post_content": "Since all of my time is currently free time, I've been spending a lot of it in parks and pubs, and \"measuring out my life with coffee spoons\" in cafes.  Sometimes, I get to talk to strangers.\r\n\r\nI was in the Crown and Anchor, writing in my journal, when I noticed a scruffy but pretty girl drinking a beer and reading Bertrand Russell's <em>A History of Western Philosophy<\/em>.  I assumed she was a philosophy student (as I was myself once).  She asked me to watch her stuff for a minute, and when she got back I asked her if she was carrying that heavy tome for self-defense on the mean streets of London, or if it was for a course.  It turns out she's doing a philosophy degree at UCL.\r\n\r\nIt may be that reading technique has declined since I was a student:  hers involved moving her head side-to-side as if she were watching a miniature tennis match taking place on the pages of her book.  I got the impression from this that the book was a little bit for show, and that she was absorbing more Beck's than Bertrand.  Philosophy students weren't pretentious back in my day, oh no.\r\n\r\nFor laughs, I was tempted to ask, \"What are you going to do with a degree in philosophy?\"  I didn't, as I know from experience how annoying that question can be.  Instead, I confessed that I had done a degree in philosophy, followed shortly by another.  I should have added, \"And now I'm unemployed.\"\r\n\r\nI'm reading <em>The Undercover Economist<\/em> (which itself struggles with pretension); it had this analysis of the value of philosophy degrees:\r\n<blockquote>Spence himself first used his insight to show why students might choose to pursue a degree in philosophy, which is difficult but does not lead to specific career opportunities, like an economics degree or a marketing degree.  Assume that employers would like to hire smart, diligent workers but can't tell from an interview who is smart or diligent.  Assume also that everyone has to work hard to obtain a philosophy degree, but lazy, dumb people find it particularly troublesome.\r\n\r\nSpence then shows that smart, diligent people can prove they're smart and diligent by going to the trouble of getting a philosophy degree.  It's not that lazy, dumb people can't get that degree but that they wouldn't want to:  employers will pay philosophy graduates enough to compensate them for the trouble but not enough to persuade lazy, dumb people to bother.  The employers are willing to do this despite the fact that the philosophy degree itself does not improve the candidate's productivity at all.  It is merely a credible signal, because a philosophy degree is too much trouble for lazy, dumb people to acquire.<\/blockquote>\r\nIs this an accurate analysis?  A friend of mine was studying for a mid-term in a course called Gemstones and Gemology.  I said, \"Are you really going to get college credit for a course on jewelry?\"  She came back with, \"What are you studying?  Aristotle?  What use is that to anybody?\"  So I bet her that I could take the practice exam she was working on and that Aristotle would help me do better than she had after three months of lectures on the subject.\r\n\r\nI took the test.  Not only did I beat my friend's score, I got everything right.  Why?  Aristotle is the foundation of western science.  If you understand Aristotle, you understand how scientific problems are formulated.  In addition, since he started the tradition and his disciples continue it, much of scientific terminology is in Greek or Latin.  I don't have to take a class to tell me what \"anisotropic\" means -- the word itself tells me, and I can guess from it (for example) that anisotropic gems split light in different directions.  (This sort of thing is why it's still worth studying Greek*, even for the pragmatically minded.)  Finally, as the founder of syllogistic logic, Aristotle gives insight into contradictions that allow a test-taker to eliminate incorrect options and to see how questions later in the exam illuminate earlier ones.\r\n\r\nThis is a roundabout way of objecting to the assertion that philosophy \"does not improve the candidate's productivity\".  I think philosophy, like mathematics or other problem-solving disciplines, does increase productivity by giving students tools to analyze problems and to accelerate learning.  And I doubt that most students who study philosophy choose the degree to signal diligence and brains to potential employers -- there are more direct ways of doing this, and most philosophy students don't think about future employment at all**.  Being able to do your coursework in the pub is probably a much more important factor.\r\n\r\n*  I was flipping through a book called something like <em>The Smartest Guy in the World<\/em> in an airport bookstore, about someone who read everything he could to be a success on the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.  I put it down when he confessed that the multiple-choice question he missed was, \"What are red blood cells called?\"  One of the answers, <em>erythrocyte<\/em>, means \"red cell\" in Greek.  Can't be that smart.\r\n\r\n** A friend of mine wrote a comic that I thought was funny at university:  A guy is standing behind a cash register and the customer asks, \"Where's my change?\"  The guy answers, \"True change comes from within.\"  The caption is, \"Why philosophy majors have trouble finding a job.\"",

    "post_content": "In at least one Amazonian language, pitch conveys much of the meaning of an expression, which makes it possible to whistle anything you want to say.  As a result, Pirahã speakers can with little effort hold whistled conversations with people whom they can't see.\r\n\r\nI found this idea fascinating and bizzare, but a little reflection turned up a few examples in English where most of the meaning is encoded in pitch.  For example, if you say, \"I don't know' without opening your mouth or moving your tonge (try it), the low-high-low pitch pattern alone conveys the meaning to other English speakers.\r\n\r\nBut not to speakers of other languages.  When I first moved to France to study, I would occasionally, unconsciously substitute \"uh-huh\" and \"huh-uh\" for <em>Yes <\/em>and <em>No<\/em>.  Because the \"h\" phoneme is not significant in French, French speakers who had not learned English had trouble differentiating the two grunts, and I had to unlearn them.\r\n<blockquote>Yes = uh-huh, mm-hmm\r\nNo = huh-uh, nuh-uh, hm-mm (first \"m\" is actually a glottal stop)<\/blockquote>\r\nIf you add pitch to the mix, you can say \"no way\":  \"say\" <em>huh-uh<\/em>, but extend the final <em>uh<\/em> and give it a falling tone.\r\n\r\nAll this is a long prelude to explain a linguistic discovery a friend and I made some time ago.  German and French both have a word that is a combination of contradiction + assertion.  In English, you need to use a circumlocution.  An example should make it clear:\r\n\r\n \r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You didn't pay the telephone bill, did you?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I did too.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n \r\n\r\nIn English you say, <em>I did too<\/em>, <em>I did so<\/em>, or <em>Yes, I did<\/em>, but in German you can say simply <em>Doch<\/em> (In French it is <em>Si<\/em>.)  Why doesn't English have a one word equivalent for contradicting people?  It turns out that it does, but most people stop using it once they are out of their teens (if they ever use it at all).  To the list of meaningful grunts in English, you can add <em>yeah-huh<\/em> (or <em>yuh-huh<\/em>), which means <em>Yes, so<\/em>.  Pitch is expressive here as well:  the more pitch variation you apply to the \"huh\" syllable, the more obviously wrong you imply your interlocutor is.",

Today of course is perfect weather for a hike, sunny but slightly cool.  Yesterday's excursion made us appreciate our dinner (spätzle for me) in the St. Valentine Gasthaus, though, and I slept past 9:00a again this morning for just the second time in over two years.  (The first time was last Tuesday.)\r\n\r\nPhotos to come!",

    "post_content": "Although I've dropped out of working life for the moment, I still spend time online almost every day (not just updating this blog!).  My online life is made more interesting and effective by the German keyboard.\r\n\r\nThis bit of gibberish:\r\n<blockquote>siteÖwikipedia Äqwertz kezboardÄ<\/blockquote>\r\nIs what you get as an American touch-typist pounding out the following google search:\r\n<blockquote>site:wikipedia \"qwerty keyboard\"<\/blockquote>\r\nAfter a few weeks in London, I got used to most of the English keyboard's quirks.  These consist mainly of swapping @ and \", and adding the £ key where Americans are used to the #.  One quirk shared by the English and German keyboards is the slightly larger Enter key that has metastasized to engulf the forward slash+pipe key.  *NIX users typing something like \"rmdir .\/tmp\/old_files\/\" tend to panic when the first forward slash is accidentally converted into an execute.\r\n\r\nBut the German keyboard seems slightly more unfriendly to the average internet user than the American or British keyboard setup.  The @ symbol, for example, is written with right-alt+q, which is fairly inconvenient for something you type frequently in email, and the forward slash is in the number range, a little out of reach.  These criticisms might be unfair:  If email address protocol had been developed by someone working on a German keyboard, the @ might have been replaced with something more readily to hand, like ä, which you don't even need the shift key to produce on a <a title=\"Qwertz keyboard\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/QWERTZ\" target=\"_blank\">qwertz<\/a> keyboard.\r\n\r\nBut the most troublesome difference is the smallest one, namely the swapping of the y and z keys.  It not only requires a kind of double-think each time you want to type one of those characters, but because Undo is mapped to Ctl-z, when you get something wrong, your attempt to Undo it gets translated into Repeat.",

    "post_content": "Friday ended up being a busy day even though we hadn't planned anything in advance.  I finished some paperwork in the morning, and so was able to play a couple of hours of ping-pong in the afternoon with a clear conscience.  After our warm-up, I lost four games in a row because, well, I hadn't played for years, I decided to change my grip that day, the sun was in my eyes...\r\n\r\nThe two Meli's joined us for dinner afterward (I cooked, but it was good), then we drove through woods that looked like something out of The Blair Witch Project up the side of a mountain to a Lindy Hop dance.  There were a fair number of people there, the music was good, and it was cool to see the lights of Freiburg twinkling in the valley to one side of the dance floor.",

    "post_content": "I don't want anyone to say I haven't been making good use of my time off.\r\n\r\nI was reading the Economist online and saw a comment in the business section that YouTube was changing people's lives — for example by teaching them how to tie their shoelaces.\r\n\r\nI did a search for \"how to tie your shoes\" on <a title=\"How to tie your shoes tutorials on youtube.com\" href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?rlz=1C1GGLS_enDE291DE313&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=site:youtube.com+how+to+tie+your+shoes\" target=\"_blank\">youtube.com<\/a> and found over a thousand relevant tutorials.  Many of them demonstrated a method that is at least twice as fast as the (three) methods I already knew.\r\n\r\nLet's say I wasted a second a day for the years I've been tying my shoes using the less efficient method.  That's about two wasted weeks, if I don't account for the years I lived in Japan (during which I wore mainly shoes without laces).  That's two weeks that I could have devoted to watching \"youtubetorials\" on how to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QVYiHI4cGlE&amp;NR=1\" target=\"_blank\">take off <\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=b5AWQ5aBjgE\" target=\"_blank\">fold T-shirts faster<\/a>.  That should probably count as life-changing.\r\n",

    "post_content": "In at least one Amazonian language, pitch conveys much of the meaning of an expression, which makes it possible to whistle anything you want to say.  As a result, Pirahã speakers can with little effort hold whistled conversations with people whom they can't see.\r\n\r\nI found this idea fascinating and bizzare, but a little reflection turned up a few examples in English where most of the meaning is encoded in pitch.  For example, if you say, \"I don't know' without opening your mouth or moving your tonge (try it), the low-high-low pitch pattern alone conveys the meaning to other English speakers.\r\n\r\nBut not to speakers of other languages.  When I first moved to France to study, I would occasionally, unconsciously substitute \"uh-huh\" and \"huh-uh\" for <em>Yes <\/em>and <em>No<\/em>.  Because the \"h\" phoneme is not significant in French, French speakers who had not learned English had trouble differentiating the two grunts, and I had to unlearn them.\r\n<blockquote>Yes = uh-huh, mm-hmm\r\nNo = huh-uh, nuh-uh, hm-mm (first \"m\" is actually a glottal stop)<\/blockquote>\r\nIf you add pitch to the mix, you can say \"no way\":  \"say\" <em>huh-uh<\/em>, but extend the final <em>uh<\/em> and give it a falling tone.\r\n\r\nAll this is a long prelude to explain a linguistic discovery a friend and I made some time ago.  German and French both have a word that is a combination of contradiction + assertion.  In English, you need to use a circumlocution.  An example should make it clear:\r\n\r\n \r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You didn't pay the telephone bill, did you?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I did too.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n \r\n\r\nIn English you say, <em>I did too<\/em>, <em>I did so<\/em>, or <em>Yes, I did<\/em>, but in German you can say simply <em>Doch<\/em> (In French it is <em>Si<\/em>.)  Why doesn't English have a one word equivalent for contradicting people?  It turns out that it does, but most people stop using it once they are out of their teens (if they ever use it at all).  To the list of meaningful grunts in English, you can add <em>yeah-huh<\/em> (or <em>yuh-huh<\/em>), which means <em>Yes, so<\/em>.  Pitch is expressive here as well:  the more pitch variation you apply to the \"huh\" syllable, the more obviously wrong you imply your interlocutor is.",

    "post_content": "In at least one Amazonian language, pitch conveys much of the meaning of an expression, which makes it possible to whistle anything you want to say.  As a result, Pirahã speakers can with little effort hold whistled conversations with people whom they can't see.\r\n\r\nI found this idea fascinating and bizzare, but a little reflection turned up a few examples in English where most of the meaning is encoded in pitch.  For example, if you say, \"I don't know' without opening your mouth or moving your tonge (try it), the low-high-low pitch pattern alone conveys the meaning to other English speakers.\r\n\r\nBut not to speakers of other languages.  When I first moved to France to study, I would occasionally, unconsciously substitute \"uh-huh\" and \"huh-uh\" for <em>Yes <\/em>and <em>No<\/em>.  Because the \"h\" phoneme is not significant in French, French speakers who had not learned English had trouble differentiating the two grunts, and I had to unlearn them.\r\n<blockquote>Yes = uh-huh, mm-hmm\r\nNo = huh-uh, nuh-uh, hm-mm (first \"m\" is actually a glottal stop)<\/blockquote>\r\nIf you add pitch to the mix, you can say \"no way\":  \"say\" <em>huh-uh<\/em>, but extend the final <em>uh<\/em> and give it a falling tone.\r\n\r\nAll this is a long prelude to explain a linguistic discovery a friend and I made some time ago.  German and French both have a word that is a combination of contradiction + assertion.  In English, you need to use a circumlocution.  An example should make it clear:\r\n\r\n \r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You didn't pay the telephone bill, did you?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I did too.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n \r\n\r\nIn English you say, <em>I did too<\/em>, <em>I did so<\/em>, or <em>Yes, I did<\/em>, but in German you can say simply <em>Doch<\/em> (In French it is <em>Si<\/em>.)  Why doesn't English have a one word equivalent for contradicting people?  It turns out that it does, but most people stop using it once they are out of their teens (if they ever use it at all).  To the list of meaningful grunts in English, you can add <em>yeah-huh<\/em> (or <em>yuh-huh<\/em>), which means <em>Yes, so<\/em>.  Pitch is expressive here as well:  the more pitch variation you apply to the \"huh\" syllable, the more obviously wrong you imply your interlocutor is.",

    "post_content": "Back in Freiburg it is rainy and cold, and I have a cold.  I spent a few minutes online today googling \"Shanghai Bob\" to see what comes up.  Apparently the most competition for this name comes from the Shanghai Bob Valve Company.  It's not obvious what scope <em>Bob<\/em> has in that name — is it modified by <em>Shanghai <\/em>(the valve company that belongs to Shanghai Bob) or does it modify <em>valve<\/em> (the Shanghai company that produces bob valves, whatever they might be).\r\n\r\nThe fact that the email contact is bob@bobvalve.com, and that the inventory lists ball valves, gate valves, globe valves, check valves, butterfly valves, plug valves, and slab gate valves, but no bob valves, suggests that the first explanation is correct.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I found my site at the top of page three, which is pretty good considering that it was nowhere to be found just a month ago.  I'll check again over the next year and see how it improves.  The real test will be once I make it to Shanghai to see where this blog comes in a search for just the word <em>Shanghai<\/em>.",

Apparently the most competition for this name comes from the Shanghai Bob Valve Company.  It's not obvious what scope <em>Bob<\/em> has in that name — is it modified by <em>Shanghai <\/em>(the valve company that belongs to Shanghai Bob) or does it modify <em>valve<\/em> (the Shanghai company that produces bob valves, whatever they might be).\r\n\r\nThe fact that the email contact is bob@bobvalve.com, and that the inventory lists ball valves, gate valves, globe valves, check valves, butterfly valves, plug valves, and slab gate valves, but no bob valves, suggests that the first explanation is correct.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I found my site at the top of page three, which is pretty good considering that it was nowhere to be found just a month ago.  I'll check again over the next year and see how it improves.  The real test will be once I make it to Shanghai to see where this blog comes in a search for just the word <em>Shanghai<\/em>.",

    "post_content": "The autumnal equinox is in five days, on September 22 this year, and the temperature has dropped a few degrees in anticipation.  It's sunny again in Freiburg, but everybody is wrapped up against the cold and the leaves are starting to turn.  The first few weeks of September were beautiful here, but because I spent June, July, and August in London this year, I was robbed of a summer.  I'm hoping Thailand in November will make up for it.\r\n\r\nSomething else typical of Freiburg:  mosaics.  Every shop has a stone mosaic on the sidewalk in front of their store, and the public buildings do as well.  This is Freiburg's <em>Wappen<\/em>, or coat of arms, with St. George's cross, just like the English flag.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/wappen.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-839 aligncenter\" title=\"wappen\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/wappen-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nThe sunshine and shadow of a bicycle are also typical of Freiburg.\r\n\r\nI found out that you can live in a large, quiet, clean apartment near the center of the city for just €250\/month, or for €150\/month a little outside the city (in St. George, for example!).  These numbers haven't changed much since I was a student (though of course they were designated in Marks then).  In practical terms, you can pay your rent for an entire year in Freiburg on what it costs for one month's rent in London or Tokyo, or for less than two months' rent in San Francisco.",

    "post_content": "Back in Freiburg it is rainy and cold, and I have a cold.  I spent a few minutes online today googling \"Shanghai Bob\" to see what comes up.  Apparently the most competition for this name comes from the Shanghai Bob Valve Company.  It's not obvious what scope <em>Bob<\/em> has in that name — is it modified by <em>Shanghai <\/em>(the valve company that belongs to Shanghai Bob) or does it modify <em>valve<\/em> (the Shanghai company that produces bob valves, whatever they might be).\r\n\r\nThe fact that the email contact is bob@bobvalve.com, and that the inventory lists ball valves, gate valves, globe valves, check valves, butterfly valves, plug valves, and slab gate valves, but no bob valves, suggests that the first explanation is correct.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I found my site at the top of page three, which is pretty good considering that it was nowhere to be found just a month ago.  I'll check again over the next year and see how it improves.  The real test will be once I make it to Shanghai to see where this blog comes in a search for just the word <em>Shanghai<\/em>.",

    "post_content": "One of my friends in grad school gave her students instructions to observe and record a conversational misunderstanding.  One of her apparently hapless students gave several examples from his own interactions during the week.  In one, he met a girl in a bar and found out they both ran track for the university.  After chatting for some time, she said, \"We should go out some time\", meaning <em>go out on a date<\/em>.  He thought she meant <em>go out for a run<\/em>, so answered, \"How far do you go?\"\r\n\r\nIn Japanese, the word <em>hai<\/em> means \"yes\", and is also used to indicate that you have heard or are listening to someone.  It sounds pretty much like the <em>hi<\/em> that English speakers use for <em>hello<\/em>, which made the following exchange common:\r\n<blockquote>Foreign guest:  Takemura-san?\r\n\r\nTakemura: Hai!\r\n\r\nForeign guest: Oh, hi!  [sometimes accompanied by a wave].  I just wanted to ask you...<\/blockquote>\r\nWhen I was waiting in the Frankfurt airport for the bomb to be cleared off the train back to Freiburg, several extremely pretty girls and one dude were wandering around with clipboards approaching people.  Guess which one came to talk to me?  He asked me in German, <em>Do you live in Germany? <\/em> I answered in English, <em>No<\/em>.  He appeared to interpret that as, No, I don't understand you\/don't understand German, and mirrored that back to me in pidgin English:  <em>You no German?<\/em>  I said, <em>That's right<\/em>.  Basically he didn't understand any of the immediate intention behind my responses, but was still able to draw out the full pragmatic value of the exchange, namely that I didn't want to talk to him.",

I gathered another data point for my upcoming \"Gelato Index\", a measure of purchasing power parity based on the cost of two scoops of gelato.  It's 2 Euros in the Königsalle.\r\n\r\nStrangely, one of the big attractions in Düsseldorf is Japanese food.  The city has just over 600,000 inhabitants, and around 1% of them are Japanese.  We had ramen.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-796  aligncenter\" title=\"duesseldorframen\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/duesseldorframen-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\nWe had to wait in line outside the place (just like at a real ramen-ya in Tokyo), and had an interesting exchange in which the Japanese hostess took our order in German while we conversed in English.  When we had finished ordering, we offered the menu to our Japanese neighbor in Japanese, and he, having heard our conversation, accepted in English.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-798  aligncenter\" title=\"manpreetnaniwa\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/manpreetnaniwa-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\nMy train home was delayed over an hour by a bomb scare.",

It's 2 Euros in the Königsalle.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-874\" title=\"koenigsalleegelato\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/koenigsalleegelato-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/>\r\n\r\nStrangely, one of the big attractions in Düsseldorf is Japanese food.  The city has just over 600,000 inhabitants, and around 1% of them are Japanese.  We had ramen.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-796  aligncenter\" title=\"duesseldorframen\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/duesseldorframen-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\nWe had to wait in line outside the place (just like at a real ramen-ya in Tokyo), and had an interesting exchange in which the Japanese hostess took our order in German while we conversed in English.  When we had finished ordering, we offered the menu to our Japanese neighbor in Japanese, and he, having heard our conversation, accepted in English.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-798  aligncenter\" title=\"manpreetnaniwa\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/manpreetnaniwa-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\nMy train home was delayed over an hour by a bomb scare.",

I've learned to invite my \"mates\" back to my \"gaff\" (invite my homies back to my crib, yo) and to pronounce Bethnal Green like the locals do (Beffnal Green).  Both are good for a laugh, since no one expects an American to talk like that.\r\n\r\nI get lessons from strangers, too.  Today as I was walking through the West End, I stopped by Fortnum and Mason to get a snack to eat in the park.  I settled on a pork pie, and asked the clerk if he could heat it up, to which he replied, \"The pork pie likes to be eaten cold, sir.\"  I thought this was a pleasantly indirect way of telling me how to act (a lesson in itself!).

    "post_content": "Here are a few questions that keep coming up; they probably give an indication of where I've been spending my time.  (For the record, I generally opt for the gelateria.)  All these explanations are <a title=\"The three sentence rule\" href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/boblog\/the-three-sentence-rule\" target=\"_self\">three sentences or less<\/a>, and I will add new questions as they arise.\r\n\r\n<h4>What is the difference between ice cream and gelato?<\/h4>\r\n<strong><\/strong>Ice cream is made with cream (no surprise there), while gelato is made with (high fat) milk and has less air whipped in.  Ice cream freezers are colder than gelato freezers.  All these things contribute to the difference in texture that is the most notable macro-level distinction between ice cream and gelato.\r\n\r\n<h4>What is the difference between lager\/pilsener and ale\/bitter\/porter\/stout?<\/h4>\r\nThe difference is in the type of yeast used:  lagers use \"bottom-fermenting\" yeast and are fermented at colder temperatures.  Top-fermenting yeast and higher temperatures produce ales and the ale subclasses of bitter, porter, stout, etc.       \r\n\r\nSince yeast is the agent for <a title=\"Define &quot;ester&quot;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=define:+ester\" target=\"_blank\">ester<\/a> and alcohol production, higher temperatures and ale yeast generally produce more complex flavors and more alcohol by volume.\r\n<h4>What is the difference between a cathedral and a minster?<\/h4>\r\nA minster (as in Westminster Abbey) is a kind of cathedral, one that was originally attached to a monastery.\r\n\r\n<h4>What is the difference between a nickname and a moniker?<\/h4>\r\nA nickname is a name that other people give you (Bobby Dazzler).  A moniker, like a handle, is a name you choose for yourself (Shanghai Bob).",

The churchyard is always full of men in long coats sharing bottles, but this looks more and more like a station in their retreat.  As the galleries spread and new businesses like the Days Hotel spring up (bringing understandably bewildered Japanese tourists on package holidays to Hackney Road), the streets are getting busier and less dangerous, and you stand a decent chance now of flagging down a taxi when you need one.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-471\" title=\"hackneyroad\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/hackneyroad-202x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"202\" height=\"300\" \/>\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to like about this area, not least the awareness of how quickly it is changing from dangerous to merely \"edgy\":  \"Live East, Die Young\" is a common slogan on hoodies and art student leather jackets; that's not the sort of thing you would wear if \"Murder Mile\" were really still a good description of your neighborhood.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, Manny came by with a van to help me take my things to charity.  On Sunday, I finished my inventory of possessions, and on Monday the movers came and hauled everything away.  It's funny how quickly you can go from being constrained (with furniture, property, and obligations) to being free.  Three days, really.  It's even funnier how much respect you get from other drivers when you're behind the wheel of a big white van -- it looked to Manny and myself like regard for the working man, but maybe it was fear for their paint jobs.\r\n\r\nWhen I was saying my goodbyes, my landlord (an artist and entrepreneur who turned this old handbag factory into a beautiful apartment block) told me, \"The business culture here is aggressive, it goes back to the Angles and the Saxons -- everyone is out for what they can get.  If I were a man your age, I would get out of London and settle somewhere else.\"  I'm not sure if China is going to be any kind of respite from aggressiveness and selfishness, but it will have the advantage of seeming more like a game, since the experience will be filtered through a language and culture that are more foreign to me than the near relation of English.  (What is the American relationship with the British, exactly?  You sometimes hear Brits talk of \"our American cousins\" (when they are being friendly), but I always imagine Britain to be like an uncle -- sometimes literally avuncular, sometimes like the old men in the Monty Python skit who say, \"Back in MY day, our dad used to wake us up four hours before we went to bed, feed us a lump of cold poison, then we had to walk to school barefoot in the snow UPHILL in both directions...kids these days!\")\r\n\r\nThis is some of what I will miss:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Victoria Park, which on Bonfire Night last year hosted one of the best fireworks display I've ever seen (including Edokawa's hanabi)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Broadway Market and the cupcakes (made by a fellow Californian transplant)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Hoxton Square and Curtain Road<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The host of strip clubs within five minutes' walk of my flat (I did intentionally visit every one of them at least once, but I did not spend nearly as much time there as I would have before I lived in Tokyo)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Columbia Road's flower market, and the two restaurants on the east side:  The Sting Ray Globe Cafe and Laxeiro<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Brick Lane and the 24-hour Beigel [sic] Bake<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The outdoor picnic benches at The Vibe Bar<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The vandals\/\"street artists\" who make living in Hackney a kind of treasure hunt:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/boblog\/36-views-of-hackney-banksy\/\" target=\"_self\">Banksy<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li><a title=\"Eine\" href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/boblog\/36-views-of-hackney-eine\/\" target=\"_self\">Eine<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li><a title=\"Invader\" href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/boblog\/36-views-of-hackney-invader\/\" target=\"_self\">Invader<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li>The local \"ad-jammer\" whose name I couldn't discover on the web<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/li>\r\n\t<li>New Tayyab's (I guess this is technically in Whitechapel, but it beats all the Bangladeshi places on the more famous Brick Lane by a mile)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Regent's Canal<\/li>\r\n\t<li>All the art galleries<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The accent!

It's sunny again in Freiburg, but everybody is wrapped up against the cold and the leaves are starting to turn.  The first few weeks of September were beautiful here, but because I spent June, July, and August in London this year, I was robbed of a summer.  I'm hoping Thailand in November will make up for it.\r\n\r\nSomething else typical of Freiburg:  mosaics.  Every shop has a stone mosaic on the sidewalk in front of their store, and the public buildings do as well.  This is Freiburg's <em>Wappen<\/em>, or coat of arms, with St. George's cross, just like the English flag.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/wappen.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-839  aligncenter\" title=\"wappen\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/wappen-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nThe sunshine and shadow of a bicycle are also typical of Freiburg.\r\n\r\nI found out that you can live in a large, quiet, clean apartment near the center of the city for just €250\/month, or for €150\/month a little outside the city (in St. George, for example!).  These numbers haven't changed much since I was a student (though of course they were designated in Marks then).  In practical terms, you can pay your rent for an entire year in Freiburg on what it costs for one month's rent in London or Tokyo, or for less than two months' rent in San Francisco.",

    "post_content": "There's a fair amount of physical danger in Shanghai, but not much of it seems to come from other people unless they are behind the wheel of a car.  I've seen three traffic accidents since I've been here, and have myself come close to being run over by two trucks and a bus.  I had read that traffic is dangerous in Shanghai, and Andrew told me as well, but it really is extremely dangerous.\r\n\r\nTrucks and buses that ignore pedestrians are obvious dangers, but there are some very subtle dangers, too.  The electric scooters are so quiet that you can't hear them, and they don't usually have headlights, so it's easy to step out in front of one at night.  All the intersections have very nicely laid-out crosswalks with little green men that mean nothing to traffic.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/greenlight.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1132  aligncenter\" title=\"greenlight\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/greenlight-300x219.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"219\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nThis is a frame from a video I took of a crosswalk with a green walk light and a big truck plowing through.  13 vehicles drove through in the 30 seconds that the walk light was green.  Part of the reason it's so dangerous is that traffic can come from any direction, but most of the reason is that I'm clearly subconsciously *used* to thinking I'm safe when I'm in a crosswalk and the light is green.  I have to get over that.\r\n\r\nIn terms of crime, Shanghai seems to be relatively safe.  Thieves seem more opportunistic (and incompetent) than violent.  Someone stole tiny LiYan's camera while she was in the metro, but gave it back when she grabbed his arm and asked for it.\r\n\r\nBelow is a picture of the high-tech scaffolding they use in Shanghai.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/scaffolding.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1133  aligncenter\" title=\"scaffolding\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/scaffolding-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>",

I say lucky because it turned out that I was there during a week that saw the Motor Show, several design and household fairs, the Berlin Marathon, and a number of high school Abschluss trips.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday morning I went round to 12 different hotels and pensions looking for one with a free room.  At one four-star hotel they were explaining (though I already knew from the previous seven hotels) why the week was so busy when one of the guests checking in said his colleague wasn't coming and I could have his booking.

I wish I had time to take the Trans-Siberian railway to Shanghai next week, but I will be flying instead.\r\n\r\nOn the way back to Freiburg I got a reservation for Car 6, Seat 66 at a table across from a little girl who managed to kick me in the shins every time I fell asleep and next to a guy who hadn't bathed in several days and made up for it by gargling Listerine.  At first I thought he was snoring, but his eyes were wide open along with his mouth, and he was expelling sparkling drops of mouthwash like Old Faithful.  It was hard not to laugh.",

    "post_content": "I canceled my Istanbul trip to come back to Freiburg for Imme's birthday.  I had missed it by a day last year, and it seemed a shame to miss it by just two days this year.  I'll go to Istanbul from Shanghai sometime next year.\n\nThe party was super — about 50 people came and occupied the basement of the Art Cafe until about 2:30a, after which we went dancing until around 5:30.  It was a good group of people and I think I talked to almost everyone.\n\n[gallery]",

By the time I made it to the flashy new Hauptbahnhof in Berlin, I was ready for a Döner Kebap in the city that invented them.\r\n\r\nI arrived around 11:00p on a rainy Monday and was lucky to find a room immediately at Pension Kassandra* in Uhlandstrasse.  I say lucky because it turned out that I was there during a week that saw the Motor Show, several design and household fairs, the Berlin Marathon, and a number of high school Abschluss trips.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday morning I went round to 12 different hotels and pensions looking for one with a free room.  At one four-star hotel they were explaining (though I already knew from the previous eight hotels) why the week was so busy when one of the guests checking in said his colleague wasn't coming and I could have his booking.  This was a mixed blessing because the colleague's room turned out to be a suite — I had a room, but at a price that would have paid for a week's worth of rooms elsewhere.  After booking that room I tried another four hotels before giving up — I decided I would just stay up all night on Wednesday, the one night where nobody had anything available.\r\n\r\n*I once had dinner with some friends at a restaurant where the waitress introduced herself — \"My name is Cassandra and I'll be your server tonight\".  Later, when I said I would like my main dish without mushrooms, she said, \"I'll tell the chef\", and I said, \"<a title=\"Cassandra\/Kassandra\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cassandra\" target=\"_blank\">But she won't believe you<\/a>.\"\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-967 alignnone\" title=\"berlin2\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/berlin2-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/p>",

    "post_content": "Thursday was a fairly quiet day in Berlin after staying up all night on Wednesday.  I dropped my stuff at the Pension Seifert and spent the day shopping, sightseeing, and eating.  I had pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon at a place called Julep's and I wondered how many pigs had sustained me during the month I've been in Germany.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to Cork a few months ago, I came from London where it was unusually warm for the season to an unseasonably cold Ireland and had to buy a new jacket.  The only thing in my size was orange — a color I'm used to as a UT-Austin alumnus, but not normally my first choice.  This has resulted in a snowball effect, as each new clothing purchase has to match the bright jacket, and the latest result is a pair of shiny gold shoes.  The black pair I would normally have bought made me look like a jack-o-lantern.  It's a slippery slope:  I wonder what kind of Ali G wardrobe I'll be wearing after a year of matching the new color scheme.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/goldshoes.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1006\" title=\"goldshoes\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/goldshoes-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>",

The friend said in slow, careful German, \"She wants to spend the night.\"  The guy behind their window blushed and the girl behind mine laughed aloud.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we had planned to watch a Bavarian movie called <em>The Earlier You Die, the Longer You're Dead<\/em>, but some family drama with a younger sister caught up in a Turkish\/East German conspiracy meant we drove to Lörrach and back instead.  We had dinner at Brennessel when we got home, maybe my last spätzle for some time.",

    "post_content": "One of the first poems I memorized in German was <em>Die Lorelei<\/em>, which contains the line <em>Und ruhig fließt der Rhein<\/em> (\"and peacefully flows the Rhein\").  It's useful as a reminder that the Rhein, like the Neckar and unlike most other rivers in Germany, is masculine.  But the poem is self-descriptive, in that once you get it stuck in your head, the sing-songy rhythm stays there (<em>das kommt mir nicht aus dem Sinn<\/em>).  It started up when I went for a walk along the banks of the Rhein in Düsseldorf, and got stuck for a good three days.  \r\n\r\nThere is at least one place where the Rhein doesn't flow peacefully, however, and we got to see it on Sunday.  On the way back through Switzerland, we drove to Neuhausen to see the Rheinfall.  They've built decks right on top of the flow of water, so you can lean over the edge and get a feeling of what it would be like to jump in.  The falls are not very high (in spite of being the largest waterfall in Europe), but a huge volume of water passes through, 463 cubic meters\/second on the day we were there, which is only one-third of peak flow.  We were lucky that the sun came out long enough to give us a rainbow.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[pictures coming!]<\/p>\r\n\r\nThere's a castle above the viewing decks that you can't really see except from the other side of the river.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-821  aligncenter\" title=\"rheinfaelle\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/rheinfaelle-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/p>",

We went for a Mongolian dinner Friday night, and afterward wandered around XiuJiaHui to get a feel for the neighborhood.  I took a picture of Andrew and LiYan, and two young women who were also wandering around wandered closer, and posed for a picture with their phones in the frame.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/keitais.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1081\" title=\"keitais\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/keitais-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nWe had a funny exchange in which Andrew and I talked to LiYan in Japanese, LiYan talked to the curious pair in Chinese, and Andrew and I talked to each other in English, so nobody could understand more than two sets of conversations.  Anyway, we figured out that the one on the left had a birthday but her party had been canceled (sounds like a sob story), so we invited them to Hengshan Road with us, bought the birthday girl dumplings and juice, and practiced Chinese with them.  I ran out of phrases in about two minutes and introduced the peanut game, a logic game that kept us occupied for an hour or so.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/dumplings.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1082\" title=\"dumplings\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/dumplings-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nThe two were fans of Japanese culture, and used the Japanese word \"kawaii\" about themselves, giving it a Chinese pronunciation.",

    "post_content": "On Monday we took two trains and a bus out to the Fudan University campus to see if Andrew had a made a good decision deciding to study at Jiao Tong.  By the time we were on the second train, we had already decided Yes.  Fudan is just too far away — this may be great if you need to focus on your studies, but if you want to get to know Shanghai, an hour transit time is too much.\r\n\r\nThe campus itself is big, green, and overrun with bicycles.  You would have to get a bicycle just to be able to match the pace of traffic on the sidewalks.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1114\" title=\"fudan\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/fudan-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe trip was worth it, though, as Andrew got to use the knowledge he had acquired in just three weeks of study to get us where we wanted to go.  On the way, we learned that bringing explosive briefcases on the train, spitting, and jumping down onto the tracks are problems that the Chinese authorities are working hard to eliminate.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/prohibitions1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1115\" title=\"prohibitions1\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/prohibitions1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/prohibitions2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1116\" title=\"prohibitions2\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/prohibitions2-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>",

    "post_content": "There's a fair amount of physical danger in Shanghai, but not much of it seems to come from other people unless they are behind the wheel of a car.  I've seen three traffic accidents since I've been here, and have myself come close to being run over by two trucks and a bus.  I had read that traffic is dangerous in Shanghai, and Andrew told me as well, but it really is extremely dangerous.\r\n\r\nTrucks and buses that ignore pedestrians are obvious dangers, but there are some very subtle dangers, too.  The electric scooters are so quiet that you can't hear them, and they don't usually have headlights, so it's easy to step out in front of one at night.  All the intersections have very nicely laid-out crosswalks with little green men that mean nothing to traffic.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/greenlight.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1132 aligncenter\" title=\"greenlight\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/greenlight-300x219.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"219\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nThis is a frame from a video I took of a crosswalk with a green walk light and a big truck plowing through.  13 vehicles drove through in the 30 seconds that the walk light was green.  Part of the reason it's so dangerous is that traffic can come from any direction, but most of the reason is that I'm clearly subconsciously <em>used<\/em> to thinking I'm safe when I'm in a crosswalk and the light is green.  I have to get over that.\r\n\r\nIn terms of crime, Shanghai seems to be relatively safe.  Thieves seem more opportunistic (and incompetent) than violent.  Someone stole tiny LiYan's camera while she was in the metro, but gave it back when she grabbed his arm and asked for it.\r\n\r\nBelow is a picture of the high-tech scaffolding they use in Shanghai.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/scaffolding.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1133 aligncenter\" title=\"scaffolding\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/scaffolding-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>",

I had read that traffic is dangerous in Shanghai, and Andrew told me as well, but it really is extremely dangerous.\r\n\r\nTrucks and buses that ignore pedestrians are obvious dangers, but there are some very subtle dangers, too.  The electric scooters are so quiet that you can't hear them, and they don't usually have headlights, so it's easy to step out in front of one at night.  All the intersections have very nicely laid-out crosswalks with little green men that mean nothing to traffic.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/greenlight.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1132  aligncenter\" title=\"greenlight\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/greenlight-300x219.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"219\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nThis is a frame from a video I took of a crosswalk with a green walk light and a big truck plowing through.  13 vehicles drove through in the 30 seconds that the walk light was green.  Part of the reason it's so dangerous is that traffic can come from any direction, but most of the reason is that I'm clearly subconsciously *used* to thinking I'm safe when I'm in a crosswalk and the light is green.  I have to get over that.\r\n\r\nIn terms of crime, Shanghai seems to be relatively safe.  Thieves seem more opportunistic (and incompetent) than violent.  Someone stole tiny LiYan's camera while she was in the metro, but gave it back when she grabbed his arm and asked for it.\r\n\r\nBelow is a picture of the high-tech scaffolding they use in Shanghai.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/scaffolding.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1133  aligncenter\" title=\"scaffolding\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/scaffolding-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>",

    "post_content": "We went to a couple of expat hangouts on Tongren Road yesterday.  Mallone's for a burger, then Judy's Too for a beer.  It was still relatively early when we left, so we walked across the highway to Julu Lu to continue our survey.  On the way, we saw a place called S-style Club, where \"Club\" was written in katakana.\r\n\r\nWe asked the doorman what kind of club it was and he said, \"Sorry, members only.\"  Then we asked in Japanese what kind of place it was and he said, \"Ah, you speak Japanese!  Welcome, welcome!\"  The only membership criterion is that you speak Nihongo, apparently.\r\n\r\nTonight we went to Mesa for dinner.  It is billed as \"modern Australian\", and was as good as everyone said.  Afterward we decided to try out Lounge 758, one of the dozens of karaoke clubs like S-style Club catering to Japanese staying at the New Otani Hotel in the French Concession.  The hostesses were shocked when two big white guys walked in, and doubly shocked when we started speaking Japanese (they said afterward).  The place was like a typical Japanese hostess\/karaoke club, but only one-tenth the price, and with two women from Shanghai, so we finally got to hear what the local dialect sounds like.",

    "post_content": "I mentioned in a previous post that Shanghai is dangerous, but that you're not generally in danger from other people unless they are behind the wheel of a vehicle.  Given the number of fistfights I've seen in the past week, I need to retract that statement.\r\n\r\nOn the way to the station this morning I saw a parking attendant goad a smaller scooter driver into an all-out fistfight.  A middle-aged female bystander jumped in and started slugging the attendant when it looked like it was going in his favor and it ended in a stalemate.  A traffic accident led to another fistfight, and an all-out brawl cleared one of the VIP booths at a nearby club called MT.  The brawl continued in the street where the two shirtless guys pushed and kicked each other down the sidewalk before finally throwing their arms around each other's shoulders and stumbling home together.\r\n\r\nIn every case, police or security just stood around and watched until the pugilists had punched themselves into weariness.",

Buddhism in Thailand extends to T-shirt philosophy like \"Don't fight your destiny\" (which I actually saw on a T-shirt.)\r\n\r\nThe pre-Socratic philosophers used a cart metaphor to describe our relationship to fate or destiny: We are a puppy tied to a cart — wherever the cart goes, we will go too, but we have enough freedom to decide whether to be dragged by our chain or to trot happily beside the wheels.\r\n\r\nIt's not all genial fatalism here, though. There are Lamborghinis for sale at the mall:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/lamborghini1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1358\" title=\"lamborghini\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/lamborghini1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Is this your destiny?<\/h5>",

    "post_content": "Andrew and I took the MagLev train to Pudong Airport to pick up Joel. His plane was delayed so we killed time in the Hope Star Cafe, which advertises \"Coffee and Cate\". \"Who's Cate?\", we asked the waitress, and she pointed at the display case and said, \"Cake! Cake!\". Andrew said, \"That's what I love about this place, no attention to detail.\"\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1272 aligncenter\" title=\"cate\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/cate-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\nJapanese, like Chinese, has almost exclusively \"open\" syllables, which means syllables ending in a vowel, like <em>Yo-ko-ha-ma<\/em>. Since the vowel represented by \"u\" is not strongly pronounced in Japanese, that sound is generally used as the ending to \"closed\" syllables in foreign languages, so \"baseball\" becomes <em>be-su ba-ru<\/em>. An exception is syllable-final \"t\", which is pronounced \"ts\" when combined with \"u\". In that case, Japanese uses \"o\" at the end of the syllable, so my name is <em>Roba-to<\/em> and a present is a <em>gifto<\/em>. (Some Japanese speakers are aware of this rule and conscientiously delete every \"o\" following a \"t\" or a \"d\" in English, so that a colleague once asked me if I was planning to wear my \"tuxeed\" [tuxedo] to the Christmas party.)\r\n\r\nI noticed that the hotel elevator lists \"Front Dest\" [Front Desk] as a first-floor destination, and wonder if there is some similar transliteration rule in Chinese that makes \"t\" an easy mistake for word-final \"k\".",

We went for a Mongolian dinner Friday night, and afterward wandered around XiuJiaHui to get a feel for the neighborhood.  I took a picture of Andrew and LiYan, and two girls who were also wandering around wandered closer, so I took a picture of them when they posed with their phones.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/keitais.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1081\" title=\"keitais\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/keitais-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nWe had a funny exchange in which Andrew and I talked to LiYan in Japanese, LiYan talked to the girls in Chinese, and Andrew and I talked to each other in English, so nobody could understand more than two sets of conversations.  Anyway, we figured out that the girl on the left had a birthday but her party had been canceled (sounds like a sob story), so we invited them to Hengshan Road with us, bought the birthday girl dumplings and juice, and practiced Chinese with them.  I ran out of phrases in about two minutes and introduced the peanut game, a logic game that kept us occupied for an hour or so.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/dumplings.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1082\" title=\"dumplings\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/dumplings-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nThe girls were fans of Japanese culture, and used the Japanese word \"kawaii\" about themselves, giving it a Chinese pronunciation.",

    "post_content": "Shinjuku Station in Tokyo funnels two million people a day through its miles of tunnels and 60 exits.  A Japanese urban legend says that the exits rotate every fifteen minutes and that's why it's so easy to get lost underground there.  It took me two years to learn all the exits by heart, so that one day when I was caught in Takashimaya without an umbrella during a typhoon, I was able to figure out a completely underground route home and stay dry.\n\nThe underground complex at XuJiaHui in Shanghai has only 14 exits, so it was easy enough to memorize them in a day, but there is one challenge:  instead of rotating, the exits are randomly walled up overnight.\n\nThis is a photo of Exit 11, which I have used several times, including last night:\n\nToday it's a dead end.  It looks like no exit existed there.\n\nAnother indication of the pace of change in Shanghai is this bookstore that is mentioned in the current-year edition of the Lonely Planet city guide:  it's also walled up with concrete:",

    "post_content": "One of the challenges in learning Chinese is remembering the tone for each word, but I've come up with a fool-proof method to learn tones in just a few seconds per word.\r\n\r\n<strong>Use visual memory<\/strong>\r\n\r\nSince the tone numbers (and even the tone symbols) are more or less arbitrary, you can substitute something more memorable for them. I assigned the following objects to visually represent the five tone contours in Mandarin Chinese (four tones plus \"unmarked\" tone):\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Tower<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Jet<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Swing<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Waterfall<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Pavement<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThe tower and pavement images are motionless because the tone contours they represent don't change. The others incorporate motion (imagine the jet taking off, the swing falling then rising from left to right, water plummeting down the waterfall).\r\n\r\nI also assigned colors to each object to give my memory another feature by which to \"index\" the tones and to let me use highlighter pens to flag ones I want to remember. Since any color association would also be arbitrary, I assigned the primary colors in ROYGBIV order (with one exception) to yield the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Red Tower<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Yellow Jet<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Green Swing (like Tarzan's)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Blue Waterfall<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Grey Pavement<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nPavement is the exception (grey instead of indigo), but it's appropriate both because this symbol is supposed to represent no tone and grey is kind of a non-color, and because pavement is generally grey.\r\n\r\nTo remember a word's tone, mentally picture the word with the appropriate object (or combination of objects if it's a multi-syllable word). You can try it yourself: \"Horse\" in Chinese is mă, and it's the third tone. To remember the tone, create a mental \"story\" associating a horse with a swing and\/or the color green. The crazier, sillier, more action-packed, or violent the image, the easier it is to remember, so don't just imagine a horse in a green swing (though that is probably silly enough).

You will look like you are conducting an imaginary orchestra, but adding a physical element to your tone production makes the tones easier to recall.  Many of the teachers here in Shanghai bob their head to indicate the tone instead of using their hands.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Create tone families<\/strong>. I remember the tones for cow-milk (牛奶) and milk-cow (奶牛) by remembering that the French keep dairy cows for cheese even though they don't drink much milk. I know that France is Fǎguó (3-2), so this pairing helps me remember that milk-cow is the same sequence.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Add emotional color<\/strong>. <a href=\"http:\/\/laowaichinese.net\/master-the-tones.htm\" target=\"_blank\">LaoWaiChinese.com<\/a> suggests giving each tone a personality.

I remember the tones for cow-milk (牛奶) and milk-cow (奶牛) by remembering that the French keep dairy cows for cheese even though they don't drink much milk. I know that France is Fǎguó (3-2), so this pairing helps me remember that milk-cow is the same sequence.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Add emotional color<\/strong>. <a href=\"http:\/\/laowaichinese.net\/master-the-tones.htm\" target=\"_blank\">LaoWaiChinese.com<\/a> suggests giving each tone a personality. For example, he thinks of the fifth tone as \"secretive, deceptive\".<\/li>\n<\/ol>",

Since any color association would also be arbitrary, I assigned the primary colors in ROYGBIV order (with one exception) to yield the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Red Tower<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Yellow Jet<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Green Swing (like Tarzan's)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Blue Waterfall<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Grey Pavement<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nPavement is the exception, but it's appropriate both because this symbol is supposed to represent no tone and grey is kind of a non-color, and because pavement is generally grey.\r\n\r\nTo remember a word's tone, mentally picture the word with the appropriate object (or combination of objects if it's a multi-syllable word). You can try it yourself: \"Horse\" in Chinese is mă, and it's the third tone. To remember the tone, create a mental \"story\" associating a horse with a swing. The crazier, sillier, more action-packed, or violent the image, the easier it is to remember, so don't just imagine a horse in a swing (though that is probably silly enough). Instead, put the horse in a latex suit, and put the swing in a circus, S&amp;M dungeon, or superhero training camp.\r\n\r\n* The idea owes a lot to <a title=\"Harry Lorraine\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Memory-Book-Classic-Improving-School\/dp\/0345337581\/ref=sr_1_2\/189-9798317-9177335?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1225684842&amp;sr=1-2\" target=\"_blank\">Harry Lorraine<\/a> and to <a title=\"James Heisig\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Remembering_the_Kanji_I\" target=\"_blank\">James Heisig<\/a>.",

(Really it's on the 16th floor, but the apartment doesn't number any floor ending with 4 — his building skips 4, 14, and 24 because the word for four sounds like \"death\".)  It's a great location for a student, though more expensive than the $7\/day charged by the student dorms.  This is the view out his window on the most polluted day of the trip so far.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1100\" title=\"view\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/view-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/>\r\n\r\nI'm staying in a hotel in TianPing Road not far from campus, closer to the metro station.

Although it means it has taken me longer to get over jet lag from the 9-hour flight from Germany, it also means that when Dawn's rosy fingers pull back the cover of night, I'm completely oblivious.  I've slept until noon on several days.  The combination of no appointments and a completely dark room means my sleep deficit is almost cured.\r\n\r\nAcross the street from Andrew's building is this building that looks like a keyboard.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/keyboardbuilding.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1105\" title=\"keyboardbuilding\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/keyboardbuilding-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nAcross the street from the hotel is a wet market.

(A blind person following the yellow paving stones will have some trouble with this change.)\r\n\r\nAnother indication of the pace of change in Shanghai is this bookstore that is mentioned in the current-year edition of the Lonely Planet city guide:  it's also walled up with concrete:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/closed.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1276 aligncenter\" title=\"closed\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/closed-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>",

    "post_content": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I think you can learn a lot about what people actually do in a country by looking at what is prohibited in its public spaces.   Here's the list of prohibitions from Bangkok's relatively new metro:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/prohibitions.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1308  aligncenter\" title=\"prohibitions\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/prohibitions-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nI broke one of the rules by taking this photo (second from right on the bottom).  The prohibition next to that (on the left) is specific to Thailand.  The next along on the left was hard to interpret, but I found another prohibition list with English glosses — it means \"No sitting on the floor while holding oversized balloons.\"\r\n\r\nThe <a title=\"Shanghai prohibitions\" href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/boblog\/fudan-university-is-too-far-away\/\" target=\"_self\">ones from China<\/a> show that spitting and explosives on the train are problems, and the ones from India discourage public urination.  In the US you see a lot of <em>No shirt, no shoes, no service;<\/em> <em>We reserve the right to refuse service;<\/em> and <em>No firearms<\/em>.  This last is probably because they are afraid of what you'll do if they don't serve you.",

    "post_content": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">On my flight home to Tokyo from my last trip to Bangkok, Thai Airways invited monks to board first before making the usual announcement about \"guests traveling with small children and people needing extra time.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When I got to the counter I asked why and they told me that monks are not allowed to touch women, and letting them board first helps keep them from getting accidentally jostled.  Apparently it works the same on the metro:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/monkseat.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1306  aligncenter\" title=\"monkseat\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/monkseat-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nWhile walking down Sukhumvit Road, I've been approached on two occasions by a man wearing saffron monk robes.  He was very aggressive in asking for money, and singled me out of a host of Thai people walking down the same street.  I didn't give him any money for several small reasons:  He was wearing street shoes, not sandals; he singled me (the foreigner) out, which I didn't want to encourage; he was out begging in the early evening and I had read that monks were meant to live on alms they collected each day before noon.\r\n\r\nI understand that all Thai men are monks at some stage in their lives, even if it's only for one day.  It seems to me that the point of living from alms is to learn humility and self-denial, and to understand your interdependence with other members of your community.  You can't learn these things by begging from tourists (presumably because they have more money) rather than your co-religionists.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I read this excerpt from the Diamond Sutra quoted in Paul Theroux's <em>Ghost Train To The Eastern Star<\/em> yesterday:\r\n<blockquote>Buddha teaches that the mind of a Bodhisattva should not accept the appearances of things as a basis when exercising charity.<\/blockquote>",

    "post_content": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">On my flight home to Tokyo from my last trip to Bangkok, Thai Airways invited monks to board first before making the usual announcement about \"guests traveling with small children and people needing extra time.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When I got to the counter I asked why and they told me that monks are not allowed to touch women, and letting them board first helps keep them from getting accidentally jostled.  Apparently it works the same on the metro:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/monkseat.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1306  aligncenter\" title=\"monkseat\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/monkseat-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nWhile walking down Sukhumvit Road, I've been approached on two occasions by a man wearing saffron monk robes.  He was very aggressive in asking for money, and singled me out of a host of Thai people walking down the same street.  I didn't give him any money for several small reasons:  He was wearing street shoes, not sandals; he singled me (the foreigner) out, which I didn't want to encourage; he was out begging in the early evening and I had read that monks were meant to live on alms they collected each day before noon.\r\n\r\nI understand that all Thai men are monks at some stage in their lives, even if it's only for one day.  It seems to me that the point of living from alms is to learn humility and self-denial, and to understand your interdependence with other members of your community.  You can't learn these things by begging from tourists (presumably because they have more money) rather than your co-religionists.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I read this excerpt from the Diamond Sutra quoted in Paul Theroux's <em>Ghost Train To The Eastern Star<\/em> yesterday:\r\n<blockquote>Buddha teaches that the mind of a Bodhisattva should not accept the appearances of things as a basis when exercising charity.<\/blockquote>",

This was in Rio.\r\n\r\nThe funny part was that in my next Portuguese class, we got to Chapter 5, \"How to Report an Assault to the Police.\"  I had fresh details to practice with, and learned that all of my instructors had been mugged multiple times, sometimes at gunpoint, which I guess explains why it's a chapter in the textbook.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of beggars on Sukhumvit Road, but they are generally not just poor.  Most are amputees or have otherwise deformed or diseased limbs (and sometimes faces).  Giving these people money is easier than deciding what to label it in the expense diary I am keeping for this trip.  \"Charity\" seems too grand.",

    "post_content": "On the morning of Halloween, we went to the huge Paragon Mall to get a camera for Andrew.  It was a super deal compared to China or the UK — the same camera I bought but about $250 cheaper, with the chance to get your face painted Halloween-style for free.\r\n\r\nWe are still at the tail end of the rainy season, which resembles Florida's more than Tokyo's:  20 minutes of rain every afternoon rather than days at a time.  The problem in Bangkok is drainage.  I once went three stops on the sky train and alighted to see that it had started to rain while I was underway.  Before I got back down to street level, the sudden shower had stopped, and I was congratulating myself on my perfect timing when a car drove through a standing puddle and soaked me.\r\n\r\nWe had a solid hour's worth of rain during dinner at Ruen Mallika (in a fantastic, leaky, teak house), and when we took the taxi to Soi Cowboy for a beer afterward, the taxi was throwing a bow wave.  (The pictures are on Andrew's new camera.)  When we got to Soi Cowboy, the entire street was flooded, and all the patrons who were already there when the rain started were essentially stranded.\r\n\r\nWe didn't feel like wading (literally) through the water, so we went to Nana instead.",

Beer is cheaper than at Nana, and it's pretty tame compared to its reputation, but we didn't see any of the \"shows\" on offer, so I can't say for sure it doesn't get worse.  We walked down the nearby street that caters to Japanese tourists, and I marveled anew at the inflated prices Japanese people are willing to pay abroad to establishments that adapt to their culture.  Everyone avoided us until we spoke Japanese, but we found that there is an hourly charge of 600 baht, plus 100 baht per beer, plus 200 for a \"lady drink.\"  That's 900 baht for an hour compared to 240 baht for the same thing (minus karaoke machine, but with no hourly charge) literally two streets down.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/patpong.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1323   aligncenter\" title=\"patpong\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/patpong-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nWe ended up in the quieter side street sharpening up our pool game.  There we saw the small but stout female bartender roust out a drunken German using a truncheon.  Apparently he comes there regularly and she throws him out regularly, and sometimes beats him up too.  It wasn't entertaining — he may have been obnoxious, but I don't think he should be beaten with a club.  (Though maybe he keeps coming back because that's what he's looking for.)  She smacked him twice and I had just decided to say something when he retreated.",

Buddhism in Thailand extends to T-shirt philosophy like \"Don't fight your destiny\" (which I actually saw on a T-shirt.)\n\nThe pre-Socratic philosophers used a cart metaphor to describe our relationship to fate or destiny: We are a puppy tied to a cart — wherever the cart goes, we will go too, but we have enough freedom to decide whether to be dragged by our chain or to trot happily beside the wheels.\n\nIt's not all genial fatalism here, though.  There are Lamborghinis for sale at the mall:\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/lamborghini.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1289 aligncenter\" title=\"lamborghini\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/lamborghini-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Is this your destiny?\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Is this your destiny?<\/p>",

(Really it's on the 16th floor, but the apartment doesn't number any floor ending with 4 — his building skips 4, 14, and 24 because the word for four sounds like \"death\".)  It's a great location for a student, though more expensive than the $7\/day charged by the student dorms.  This is the view out his window on the most polluted day of the trip so far.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1100\" title=\"view\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/view-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/>\r\n\r\nI'm staying in a hotel in TianPing Road not far from campus, closer to the metro station.  I am on a tenth floor which is really the tenth floor, but my only view is from the little round fisheye lens set into the door — there are no other windows.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1103\" title=\"noview\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/noview-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis has been great for me.  Although it means it has taken me longer to get over jet lag from the 9-hour flight from Germany, it also means that when Dawn's rosy fingers pull back the cover of night, I'm completely oblivious.  I've slept until noon on several days.  The combination of no appointments and a completely dark room means my sleep deficit is almost cured.\r\n\r\nAcross the street from Andrew's building is this building that looks like a keyboard.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/computerbiru.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1281 aligncenter\" title=\"computerbiru\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/computerbiru-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nAcross the street from the hotel is a wet market.

    "post_content": "On Saturday we took in the more commercial sights:  <a title=\"Pudong\" href=\"http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?q=pudong\" target=\"_blank\">Pudong<\/a>, <a title=\"XinTianDi\" href=\"http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?q=XinTianDi\" target=\"_blank\">XinTianDi<\/a>, and the <a title=\"The Bund\" href=\"http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?q=the%20bund\" target=\"_blank\">Bund<\/a>, where they had a fireworks display for China's National Day (and so kept Pudong lit up past the normal 11:00p lights-out time).  There are plenty of great photos of Pudong and such on the web (click the links above), but what you don't see are all the construction cranes.  With all the construction in Dubai, London, and China, I think renting construction cranes must be a good business to be in right now.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1089\" title=\"pudongcranes\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/pudongcranes-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/>\r\n<p \/>\r\nAt XinTianDi, we had a beer at the Paulaner Brewery, which was a slightly surreal experience after just leaving Oktoberfest in Munich -- the same brewery as our Oktoberfest tent, the same Bavarian costumes but worn by Chinese staff, beer in pint glasses instead of liters, and the dirndls suffering similar capacity issues, as a witty friend noted.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/paulaner.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1094\" title=\"paulaner\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/paulaner-292x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"292\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nWe went to Glamour Bar and then another recommendation across the street called Jean Georges.  Glamour Bar was crowded and got even more crowded as the night went on — we thought we might bring down the tone with our T-shirts and jeans, but there were guys in there wearing shorts.  Shanghai seems fairly casual about dress codes.  Jean Georges was empty, but was slightly more pleasant than Glamour Bar, which is a little tatty, like Tableaux in Tokyo's Daikanyama — you get the feeling it's been around a while.  The bar at Jean Georges doesn't have a view of Pudong, though, so can't really compete.",

Buddhism in Thailand extends to T-shirt philosophy like \"Don't fight your destiny\" (which I actually saw on a T-shirt.)\r\n\r\nThe pre-Socratic philosophers used a cart metaphor to describe our relationship to fate or destiny: We are a puppy tied to a cart — wherever the cart goes, we will go too, but we have enough freedom to decide whether to be dragged by our chain or to trot happily beside the wheels.\r\n\r\nIt's not all genial fatalism here, though.  There are Lamborghinis for sale at the mall:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/lamborghini.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1289 aligncenter\" title=\"lamborghini\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/lamborghini-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Is this your destiny?\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Is this your destiny?<\/h4>",

Beer is cheaper than at Nana, and it's pretty tame compared to its reputation, but we didn't see any of the \"shows\" on offer, so I can't say for sure it doesn't get worse.  We walked down the nearby street that caters to Japanese tourists, and I marveled anew at the inflated prices Japanese people are willing to pay abroad to establishments that adapt to their culture.  Everyone avoided us until we spoke Japanese, but we found that there is an hourly charge of 600 baht, plus 100 baht per beer, plus 200 for a \"lady drink.\"  That's 900 baht for an hour compared to 240 baht for the same thing (minus karaoke machine, but with no hourly charge) literally two streets down.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/patpong.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1323   aligncenter\" title=\"patpong\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/patpong-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n\nWe ended up in the quieter side street sharpening up our pool game.  There we saw the small but wide female bartender roust out a drunken German using a truncheon.  Apparently he comes there regularly and she throws him out regularly, and sometimes beats him up too.  It wasn't funnyentertaining — he may have been obnoxious, but I don't think he should be beaten with a club.  She smacked him twice and I had just decided to say something when he retreated.",

Where you from, my man?  You need a suit?  I hook you up, good price!\"  They all want to shake hands so they can physically hold you in place during their patter but I'm wise to that trick.

Alles gute!\"  There are no <a title=\"Zonkeys\" href=\"http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?q=zonkey\" target=\"_blank\">zonkeys<\/a>, though.\r\n\r\nThe Ronald McDonald statue in front of McD's on Bangla Road has his palms pressed together in a <em>wai<\/em>, the Thai name for the gesture of welcome and thanks that looks like prayer.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/wai.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1540  aligncenter\" title=\"wai\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/wai-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nDairy Queen is just as prevalent here as in Shanghai, but the Shanghai cup that is called a \"medium\" there is a large here, which suggests that China will plump out on foreign fast food sooner than Thailand will.\r\n\r\nI ate on the beach, though, red snapper and shrimp while listening (trying not to listen) to a two-piece combo murder one Abba song after another (the male keyboardist singing falsetto) at the request of four little blonde Swedish girls who were flitting around the stage.",

Next time someone asks, \"Spicy OK?\", I'll be a little less confident when saying Yes.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, I meant to record that China's love of spice apparently extends to ice cream.

    "post_content": "And 100 days of freedom.\r\n\r\nA Google search for \"Shanghai Bob\" now brings this blog up on the first page of results (<a title=\"Shanghai Bob climbs the charts\" href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/boblog\/shanghai-bob-climbs-the-charts\/\" target=\"_self\">previously<\/a> it was down on the third page).  Admittedly, this probably wasn't too hard to achieve given that Shanghai+Bob is an unusual combination (which is partly why I chose it).\r\n\r\nMaking it into the top ten for \"Shanghai\" or \"Chinese\" will probably be difficult, but it shouldn't be too hard to find a niche to exploit once I am settled in Shanghai.\r\n\r\nI'm winding down the adventure part of my trip now.  I'll be in Tokyo next week, in San Francisco for my birthday, then I'll head home for the holidays:  Thanksgiving in Montana and Christmas in Boston.",

    "post_content": "I took my seat (herded in with no seat assignments on AirAsia), memorized one lesson from my Chinese textbook, took a nap (critical to allow the new vocabulary to sink in), and touched down in Phuket before I knew it.\r\n\r\nThe taxi into town cost 300 baht, with an additional 100 for the driver, who has registered his car with Phuket airport.  This was still 150 baht cheaper than the \"official\" cars for hire (by suckers) inside the airport, but 280 baht more expensive than riding in the back of a pickup truck.\r\n\r\nFor the extra three bucks for a registered car you get a postcard to mail in to the airport taxi association with a handy checklist for the ways you have been ripped off:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"Overcharged fare metered rate\"<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\"Switch off the meter\"<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\"Drop off passengers before reaching destination\"<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\"Others\"<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nI thought the \"s\" after \"Other\" was less limiting than our convention of leaving it singular.\r\n\r\nI booked an overpriced (1700 baht) hotel from Bangkok, but only stayed one night.  I found a guesthouse directly across the street for 800 baht, or about $25.  My food costs are running about $10\/day, which means I can stay here basically forever.\r\n\r\nThe guesthouse is clean and quiet, but the staff are loopy.  When guests check in, the manager gives them a fruit, but it's an unripe, bitter, nasty-tasting fruit (<em>How do I know<\/em>, you ask) that looks like a kumquat.  I saw several guests eat them and disguise their reaction to be polite, but she liked the ones who made a face; she laughed and shrieked, \"I joke you!\"",

    "post_content": "Today is grey and gloomy in London, with spattering rain.  Typical mid-summer weather!  Maybe because of the rain, but probably partly because I'm leaving soon, a poem I memorized at university was running through my head today.  The original is German, here's a translation:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h4>The Flying Robert<\/h4>\r\nEscapism, you cry out to me, \r\nreproachfully. \r\nWhat else, I reply, \r\nwith this lousy weather! \r\nI open my umbrella \r\nand launch myself into the winds. \r\nFrom your point of view \r\nI become smaller and smaller, \r\nuntil I vanish. \r\nI leave behind nothing \r\nbut a legend, \r\nwith which you green-eyed monsters \r\npester your children, \r\nwhen it storms outside, \r\nso that they do not fly away from you.\r\n\r\n  — Hans Magnus Enzensberger<\/blockquote>\r\n \r\n\"You green-eyed monsters\" is a loose translation of \"ihr Neidhammel\" (you envious people) in the original.  \"Hammel\" is <em>wether<\/em> in English, and if you grew up on a ranch you might recognize that word, but if not, you probably think it's a typo for \"weather\" or \"whether\".  It means a castrated male sheep, the sheep-world equivalent of a steer.  That may seem like an obscure word, unless you recognize it as part of \"bellwether\", a word you've probably used.\r\n\r\nHere's the original:\r\n \r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h4>Der fliegende Robert<\/h4>\r\nEskapismus, ruft ihr mir zu, \r\nvorwurfsvoll. \r\nWas denn sonst, antworte ich, \r\nbei diesem Sauwetter! -, \r\nspanne den Regenschirm auf \r\nund erhebe mich in die Lüfte. \r\nVon euch aus gesehen, \r\nwerde ich immer kleiner und kleiner, \r\nbis ich verschwunden bin. \r\nIch hinterlasse nichts weiter \r\nals eine Legende, \r\nmit der ihr Neidhammel, \r\nwenn es draußen stürmt, \r\neuern Kindern in den Ohren liegt, \r\ndamit sie euch nicht davonfliegen.\r\n\r\n— Hans Magnus Enzensberger<\/blockquote>",

Since the vowel represented by \"u\" is not strongly pronounced in Japanese, that sound is generally used as the ending to \"closed\" syllables in foreign languages, so \"baseball\" becomes <em>be-su ba-ru<\/em>.  An exception is syllable-final \"t\", which is pronounced \"ts\" when combined with \"u\".  In that case, Japanese uses \"o\" at the end of the syllable, so my name is <em>Roba-to<\/em> and a present is a <em>gifto<\/em>.  (Some Japanese speakers are aware of this rule and conscientiously delete every \"o\" following a \"t\" or a \"d\" in English, so that a colleague once asked me if I was planning to wear my \"tuxeed\" [tuxedo] to the Christmas party.)\r\n\r\nI noticed that the hotel elevator lists \"Front Dest\" [Front Desk] as a first-floor destination, and wonder if there is some similar transliteration rule in Chinese that makes \"t\" an easy mistake for word-final \"k\".",

Where you from, my man?  You need a suit?  I hook you up, good price!\"  They all want to shake hands so they can physically hold you in place during their patter but I'm wise to that trick.  Some guessed I was German, so I also got the following:  \"Wie geht's?  You Berlin?  Alles gute!\"  There are no <a title=\"Zonkeys\" href=\"http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?q=zonkey\" target=\"_blank\">zonkeys<\/a>, though.\r\n\r\nThe Ronald McDonald statue in front of McD's on Bangla Road has his palms pressed together in a <em>wai<\/em>, the Thai name for the gesture of welcome and thanks that looks like prayer.  Dairy Queen is just as prevalent here as in Shanghai, but the Shanghai cup that is called a \"medium\" there is a large here, which suggests that China will plump out on foreign fast food sooner than Thailand will.\r\n\r\nI ate on the beach, though, red snapper and shrimp while listening (trying not to listen) to a two-piece combo murder one Abba song after another (the male keyboardist singing falsetto) at the request of four little blonde Swedish girls who were flitting around the stage.",

There I found preserved all the French rough edges that elsewhere have been worn smooth by globalization.  It was a museum of snobby waiters, pretentious patrons in black turtlenecks, and little yapping dogs inside restaurants.\r\n\r\nThe little black dog was like the familiar of the witch sitting opposite.  The witch was a French academic specializing (I gathered) in the representation of justice and the law in French literature, with an emphasis on Balzac.  Her interlocutor was a fellow academic with a mop of Warholesque gray hair, the black turtleneck, and an American accent in both English and French.  She switched to French for the pretentious bits of her conversation (I'm not sure if that is good camouflage...).  I tried to screen her out, but heard snatches over the barking of the dog, including this good example, \"The salient features of violence are its suddenness and the damage that accompanies it.\"  I would classify this as a tautology, but perhaps it sounds better in French.  So much for the dog and patrons.  As for the waiters, I watched two of them ignore a poor Japanese couple who were pressed for time.  The third finished sorting forks into a container then walked across the restaurant to replace the tray he had been using before coming over finally to take their order.  Service in Japan is so outstanding, Japanese people must be traumatized the first time they go abroad and learn they are expected to pay extra (that is, to leave a tip, which is not the custom in Japan) for snootiness and indifference.\r\n\r\nTotal damage at Café Angelina was €28, the same as the price of a single drink at the Hemingway Bar at the Ritz (I ordered a \"Poire Victoire\").  It is also half the cost of lunch at Café de la Paix (next to the Opéra) for the same number of courses, and exactly four times *more* than the beautiful, simple set lunch I had at a cafe called Chocolino near the Madeleine Church.  The locals seem to think highly of Chocolino as well:  in the 15-20 minutes it took me to order and eat my lunch, there was a constant line ten people deep.  With throughput at around three people per minute, I saw around 50 people go through that place in a very short time.",

    "post_content": "Several times in the past two days the same woman has pointed to the empty sidewalk in front of me, reached down and pretended to pick up a gold ring that she had been hiding in her hand.  The first time she gave it to me although I tried to decline it.  She showed me that it was too small to fit her (though that would mean it was certainly too small to fit me) and forced it on me.  Then she came back ten seconds later and asked for money.  I assume she probably has better luck with people who actually put the ring on (or ones who don't notice that she is conjuring the ring out of thin air).  Her \"office\" is around the Louvre, but she has so many customers, she didn't recognize me until she tried the trick for the third time.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/louvre.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1508  aligncenter\" title=\"louvre\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/louvre-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nIn Brazil I had a similar kind of trick played on me, also three times:  a guy points at your shoe, you look down to see that it is covered with bird guano.  The guy happens to have a shoeshine kit with him and cleans your dirty shoe for 5 reais, then asks for a tip to \"even them up\".  The first time this happened, I thought it was strange that I hadn't notice any birds or the mess on my shoe.  The second time it happened, I was sure that the shoeshine guy had fouled my shoe, but I didn't see how he did it.  The third time, I figured it out:  the guy points at your shoe, you look down and don't see anything.  You look back up at him and say, \"What?\".  While he's keeping his eyes locked on yours, he squirts the crud on your shoe and says, \"Look!\"  You look again and see the mess and convince yourself you just didn't notice it the first time.  I made the last guy clean my shoes for free — he denied several times that it was a scam, then finally confessed.\r\n\r\nThe virtue of his trick over the gypsy ring trick is that your shoes actually end up dirty and you have to do something about it.  The ring trick relies on a very feeble thread of obligation created when she offers the ring, and reinforced only slightly if you actually take it.\r\n\r\nThe best scam that I actually fell victim to was when someone entered my normally locked apartment complex and started ringing doorbells telling the upstairs people he was a downstairs neighbor and vice versa, asking for change to pay the pizza delivery guy.  I was suspicious, but as I was on slightly bad terms with my upstairs neighbor, having complained about the noise when he and his band held a full-volume rehearsal for seven hours on a Friday night, I thought I should make an investment in bridge-building.  After I closed the door I called the landlord and asked for a description of my upstairs neighbor.  It didn't match the guy at my door, but by that time he was gone.  That delayed suspicion was better than Ollie's, though — he came to my door about an hour later looking for his money and I had to tell him he had been conned.  His response:  \"The dirty dog!\"\r\n\r\nAfter that incident, I went and introduced myself to all my neighbors.  I also made a personal rule to look at all requests for money as simply requests for money — to ignore the story or trappings that surround the request and decide whether to give money for the sake of charity or in expectation of a return or repayment.  I think this has helped me avoid giving money in circumstances that play on the very natural inclination to be obliging, as with the false monk in Thailand.\r\n\r\n\"Don't cross a gypsy, boy\" is what the old bats in grey pea coats around Picadilly Circus curse you with if you don't let them put a flower in your buttonhole.  If you do let them, they hit you up for cash.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/orsay.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1509  aligncenter\" title=\"orsay\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/orsay-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>",

On Wednesday I ate wild boar (<em>sanglier<\/em> — just like <a title=\"Asterix and Obelix\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Asterix\" target=\"_blank\">Asterix and Obelisk<\/a>!) at a place called Aux Lyonnais with JunYi, sitting next to two Japanese men over on business from Tokyo.  They couldn't read the menu, so I helped.  They were afraid of the complicated à la carte items so stuck to the prix fixe menu, which required only binary decisions translated from French into Japanese (Cold cuts or soup?  Blood sausage or crayfish?).  Some of the offerings were a challenge to my Japanese vocabulary (What's wild boar in Japanese?  I don't know), but we figured it out.  When they originally asked for help, they asked in English, but surprisingly for them both the American and the Chinese gaijin speak Japanese.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/steakfrites.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1484  aligncenter\" title=\"steakfrites\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/steakfrites-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nIt was a good meal for a cold night, but not as good as the classic steak and fries I had at La Bourse ou la Vie (\"Your Money or Your Life\" — the French name is a pun on the restaurant's location near the Bourse).  That was so good I went back again two days later.  I also made time for flan, lemon tarts, and \"chocolate nuns\", a kind of snowman-shaped eclair.",

    "post_content": "I spent my first day in Paris at the Louvre, the second day walking to the Eiffel Tower and back, and the third day in the Musée d'Orsay looking at a special exhibition of masks.  On Wednesday I ate wild boar (sanglier -- just like Asterix and Obelisk!) at a place called Aux Lyonnais, sitting next to two Japanese men over on business from Tokyo.  They couldn't read the menu, so I helped.  They were afraid of the complicated a la carte items so stuck to the prix fixe menu, which required only binary decisions translated from French into Japanese (Cold cuts or soup?  Blood sausage or crayfish?).  Some of the offerings were a challenge to my Japanese vocabulary (What's wild boar in Japanese?  I don't know.)  I thought offering to help was a good way of letting them know their conversation was not as private as they might otherwise assume it should be with only a couple of gaijin nearby.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt was a good meal for a cold night, but not as good as the classic steak and fries I had at La Bourse ou la Vie (\"Your Money or Your Life\" -- the French name is a pun on the restaurant's location near the Bourse).  That was so good I went back again two days later.  I also made time for flan, lemon tarts, and \"chocolate nuns\", a kind of snowman-shaped eclair.",

    "post_content": "I spent my first day in Paris at the Louvre, the second day walking to the Eiffel Tower and back, and the third day in the Musée d'Orsay looking at a special exhibition of masks.  On Wednesday I ate wild boar (<em>sanglier<\/em> — just like <a title=\"Asterix and Obelix\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Asterix\" target=\"_blank\">Asterix and Obelisk<\/a>!) at a place called Aux Lyonnais, sitting next to two Japanese men over on business from Tokyo.  They couldn't read the menu, so I helped.  They were afraid of the complicated a la carte items so stuck to the prix fixe menu, which required only binary decisions translated from French into Japanese (Cold cuts or soup?  Blood sausage or crayfish?).  Some of the offerings were a challenge to my Japanese vocabulary (What's wild boar in Japanese?  I don't know.)  I thought offering to help was a good way of letting them know their conversation was not as private as they might otherwise assume it should be with only a couple of gaijin nearby.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/steakfrites.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1484  aligncenter\" title=\"steakfrites\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/steakfrites-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nIt was a good meal for a cold night, but not as good as the classic steak and fries I had at La Bourse ou la Vie (\"Your Money or Your Life\" -- the French name is a pun on the restaurant's location near the Bourse).  That was so good I went back again two days later.  I also made time for flan, lemon tarts, and \"chocolate nuns\", a kind of snowman-shaped eclair.",

    "post_content": "Several times in the past two days the same woman has pointed to the empty sidewalk in front of me, reached down and pretended to pick up a gold ring that she had been hiding in her hand.  The first time she gave it to me although I tried to decline it.  She showed me that it was too small to fit her (though that would mean it was certainly too small to fit me) and forced it on me.  Then she came back ten seconds later and asked for money.  I assume she probably has better luck with people who actually put the ring on (or ones who don't notice that she is conjuring the ring out of thin air).  Her \"office\" is around the Louvre, but she has so many customers, she didn't recognize me until she tried the trick for the third time.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn Brazil I had a similar kind of trick played on me, also three times:  a guy points at your shoe, you look down to see that it is covered with bird guano.  The guy happens to have a shoeshine kit with him and cleans your dirty shoe for 5 reais, then asks for a tip to \"even them up\".  The first time this happened, I thought it was strange that I hadn't notice any birds or the mess on my shoe.  The second time it happened, I was sure that the shoeshine guy had fouled my shoe, but I didn't see how he did it.  The third time, I figured it out:  the guy points at your shoe, you look down and don't see anything.  You look back up at him and say, \"What?\".  While he's keeping his eyes locked on yours, he squirts the crud on your shoe and says, \"Look!\"  You look again and see the mess and convince yourself you just didn't notice it the first time.  I made the last guy clean my shoes for free -- he denied several times that it was a scam, then finally confessed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe virtue of his trick over the gypsy ring trick is that your shoes actually end up dirty and you have to do something about it.  The ring trick relies on a very feeble thread of obligation created when she offers the ring, and reinforced only slightly if you actually take it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe best scam that I actually fell victim to was when someone entered my normally locked apartment complex and started ringing doorbells telling the upstairs people he was a downstairs neighbor and vice versa, asking for change to pay the pizza delivery guy.  I was suspicious, but as I was on slightly bad terms with my upstairs neighbor, having complained about the noise when he and his band held a full-volume rehearsal for seven hours on a Friday night, I thought I should make an investment in bridge-building.  After I closed the door I called the landlord and asked for a description of my upstairs neighbor.  It didn't match the guy at my door, but by that time he was gone.  That delayed suspicion was better than Ollie's, though -- he came to my door about an hour later looking for his money and I had to tell him he had been conned.  His response:  \"The dirty dog!\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAfter that incident, I went and introduced myself to all my neighbors.  I also made a personal rule to look at all requests for money as simply requests for money -- to ignore the story or trappings that surround the request and decide whether to give money for the sake of charity or in expectation of a return or repayment.  I think this has helped me avoid giving money in circumstances that play on the very natural inclination to be obliging, as with the (I suspect) false monk in Thailand.\r\n\r\n\"Don't cross a gypsy, boy\" is what the old bats in grey pea coats around Picadilly Circus curse you with if you don't let them put a flower in your buttonhole.

The one thing missing from my Museum of Old Paris was a strike leading to a riot, and the French populace kindly provided one for my Thursday evening's entertainment.  Strikers filled the Place de l'Opéra wearing signs saying Rêve Générale (a play on the word for \"strike\", grève) and shouting \"Down with Sarkozy\".\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/cameragirl.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1472 aligncenter\" title=\"cameragirl\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/cameragirl-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nA girl with a camera was making the riot police blush while it was still daylight, but as soon as it got dark, the crowd started burning things, breaking things, and throwing things.  I saw several people (standing right next to me!) throw Molotov Cocktails into green rubbish bins, which exploded and burned.  I saw two guys take advantage of the disorder to have some fun trying to smash a glass telephone booth with flying kicks.  They were easily dissuaded -- a bystander tutted at them and they sloped off.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/police.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1471 aligncenter\" title=\"police\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/police-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nI saw the police in riot gear beat the crowd back the length of the boulevard, then some of them came back to shoo me away as the crowd flung broken pieces of furniture and bottles.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/flames.jpg\"><\/a>",

Many of them demonstrated a method that is at least twice as fast as the (three) methods I already knew.\r\n\r\nLet's say I wasted a second a day for the years I've been tying my shoes using the less efficient method.  That's about two wasted weeks, if I don't account for the years I lived in Japan (during which I wore mainly shoes without laces).  That's two weeks that I could have devoted to watching \"youtubetorials\" on how to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QVYiHI4cGlE&amp;NR=1\" target=\"_blank\">take off T-shirts faster<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=b5AWQ5aBjgE\" target=\"_blank\">fold T-shirts faster<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JF1cxgY9oAE&amp;NR=1\" target=\"_blank\">strip completely just a few seconds<\/a>.

    "post_content": "Several times in the past two days the same woman has pointed to the empty sidewalk in front of me, reached down and pretended to pick up a gold ring that she had been hiding in her hand.  The first time she gave it to me although I tried to decline it.  She showed me that it was too small to fit her (though that would mean it was certainly too small to fit me) and forced it on me.  Then she came back ten seconds later and asked for money.  I assume she probably has better luck with people who actually put the ring on (or ones who don't notice that she is conjuring the ring out of thin air).  Her \"office\" is around the Louvre, but she has so many customers, she didn't recognize me until she tried the trick for the third time.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil I had a similar kind of trick played on me, also three times:  a guy points at your shoe, you look down to see that it is covered with bird guano.  The guy happens to have a shoeshine kit with him and cleans your dirty shoe for 5 reais, then asks for a tip to \"even them up\".  The first time this happened, I thought it was strange that I hadn't notice any birds or the mess on my shoe.  The second time it happened, I was sure that the shoeshine guy had fouled my shoe, but I didn't see how he did it.  The third time, I figured it out:  the guy points at your shoe, you look down and don't see anything.  You look back up at him and say, \"What?\".  While he's keeping his eyes locked on yours, he squirts the crud on your shoe and says, \"Look!\"  You look again and see the mess and convince yourself you just didn't notice it the first time.  I made the last guy clean my shoes for free — he denied several times that it was a scam, then finally confessed.\r\n\r\nThe virtue of his trick over the gypsy ring trick is that your shoes actually end up dirty and you have to do something about it.  The ring trick relies on a very feeble thread of obligation created when she offers the ring, and reinforced only slightly if you actually take it.\r\n\r\nThe best scam that I actually fell victim to was when someone entered my normally locked apartment complex and started ringing doorbells telling the upstairs people he was a downstairs neighbor and vice versa, asking for change to pay the pizza delivery guy.  I was suspicious, but as I was on slightly bad terms with my upstairs neighbor, having complained about the noise when he and his band held a full-volume rehearsal for seven hours on a Friday night, I thought I should make an investment in bridge-building.  After I closed the door I called the landlord and asked for a description of my upstairs neighbor.  It didn't match the guy at my door, but by that time he was gone.  That delayed suspicion was better than Ollie's, though — he came to my door about an hour later looking for his money and I had to tell him he had been conned.  His response:  \"The dirty dog!\"\r\n\r\nAfter that incident, I went and introduced myself to all my neighbors.  I also made a personal rule to look at all requests for money as simply requests for money — to ignore the story or trappings that surround the request and decide whether to give money for the sake of charity or in expectation of a return or repayment.  I think this has helped me avoid giving money in circumstances that play on the very natural inclination to be obliging, as with the (I suspect) false monk in Thailand.\r\n\r\n\"Don't cross a gypsy, boy\" is what the old bats in grey pea coats around Picadilly Circus curse you with if you don't let them put a flower in your buttonhole.  If you do let them, they hit you up for cash.",

Then she came back ten seconds later and asked for money.  I assume she probably has better luck with people who actually put the ring on (or ones who don't notice that she is conjuring the ring out of thin air).

The guy happens to have a shoeshine kit with him and cleans your dirty shoe for 5 reais, then asks for a tip to \"even them up\".  The first time this happened, I thought it was strange that I hadn't notice any birds or the mess on my shoe.  The second time it happened, I was sure that the shoeshine guy had fouled my shoe, but I didn't see how he did it.  The third time, I figured it out:  the guy points at your shoe, you look down and don't see anything.  You look back up at him and say, \"What?\".  While he's keeping his eyes locked on yours, he squirts the crud on your shoe and says, \"Look!\"  You look again and see the mess and convince yourself you just didn't notice it the first time.

His response:  \"The dirty dog!\"\r\n\r\nAfter that incident, I went and introduced myself to all my neighbors.  I also made a personal rule to look at all requests for money as simply requests for money — to ignore the story or trappings that surround the request and decide whether to give money for the sake of charity or in expectation of a return or repayment.

The one thing missing from my <a title=\"Old Paris\" href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/boblog\/farewell-angelina\/\" target=\"_self\">Museum of Old Paris<\/a> was a strike leading to a riot, and the French populace kindly provided one for my Thursday evening's entertainment.

I saw several people (standing right next to me!) throw Molotov Cocktails into green rubbish bins, which exploded and burned.  I saw two guys take advantage of the disorder to have some fun trying to smash a glass telephone booth with flying kicks.  They were easily dissuaded -- a bystander tutted at them and they sloped off.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/police.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1471 aligncenter\" title=\"police\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/police-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nI saw the police in riot gear beat the crowd back the length of the boulevard, then some of them came back to shoo me away as the crowd flung broken pieces of furniture and bottles.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/flames.jpg\"><\/a>",

She was a French academic specializing (I gathered) in the representation of justice and the law in French literature, with an emphasis on Balzac.  Her interlocutor was a fellow academic with a mop of Wharholesque gray hair, the black turtleneck, and an American accent in both English and French.  She switched to French for the pretentious bits of her conversation (I'm not sure if that is good camouflage...), perhaps in the hope that I couldn't follow her there.  I tried to screen her out, but heard snatches over the barking of the dog, including this good example, \"The salient features of violence are its suddenness and the damage that accompanies it.\"  I would classify this as a tautology, but perhaps it comes across better in French.  So much for the dog and patrons.  As for the waiters, I watched two of them ignore a poor Japanese couple who were pressed for time.  The third finished sorting forks into a container then walked across the restaurant to replace the tray he had been using before coming over finally to take their order.  Service in Japan is so outstanding, Japanese people must be traumatized the first time they go abroad and learn they are expected to pay extra (that is, to leave a tip, which is not the custom in Japan) for snootiness and indifference.\r\n\r\nTotal damage at Café Angelina was E28, the same as the price of a single drink at the Hemingway Bar at the Ritz (I ordered a \"Poire Victoire\").  It is also half the cost of lunch at Café de la Paix (next to the Opéra) for the same number of courses, and exactly four times *more* than the beautiful, simple set lunch I had at a cafe called Chocolino near the Madeleine Church.  The locals seem to think highly of Chocolino as well:  in the 15-20 minutes it took me to order and eat my lunch, there was a constant line ten people deep.  With throughput at around three people per minute, I saw around 50 people go through that place in a very short time.",

She was a French academic specializing (I gathered) in the representation of justice and the law in French literature, with an emphasis on Balzac.  Her interlocutor was a fellow academic with a mop of Wharholesque gray hair, the black turtleneck, and an American accent in both English and French.  She switched to French for the pretentious bits of her conversation (I'm not sure if that is good camouflage...), perhaps in the hope that I couldn't follow her there.  I tried to screen her out, but heard snatches over the barking of the dog, including this good example, \"The salient features of violence are its suddenness and the damage that accompanies it.\"  I would classify this as a tautology, but perhaps it comes across better in French.  So much for the dog and patrons.  As for the waiters, I watched two of them ignore a poor Japanese couple who were pressed for time.  The third finished sorting forks into a container then walked across the restaurant to replace the tray he had been using before coming over finally to take their order.  Service in Japan is so outstanding, Japanese people must be traumatized the first time they go abroad and learn they are expected to pay extra (that is, to leave a tip, which is not the custom in Japan) for snootiness and indifference.\r\n\r\nTotal damage at Café Angelina was €28, the same as the price of a single drink at the Hemingway Bar at the Ritz (I ordered a \"Poire Victoire\").  It is also half the cost of lunch at Café de la Paix (next to the Opéra) for the same number of courses, and exactly four times *more* than the beautiful, simple set lunch I had at a cafe called Chocolino near the Madeleine Church.  The locals seem to think highly of Chocolino as well:  in the 15-20 minutes it took me to order and eat my lunch, there was a constant line ten people deep.  With throughput at around three people per minute, I saw around 50 people go through that place in a very short time.",

    "post_content": "I've been off work for the past two weeks, but today is officially my last day.  Not going into the office was surprisingly easy to get used to, but not getting paid is probably going to take more adjustment.\r\n\r\nI decided to take a sabbatical to do some traveling before moving to Shanghai to study Chinese.  Since I announced my decision, I've received a lot of kind notes and encouragement from friends and even relative strangers.  Many of them say that it is a brave thing to do.  Is that code for \"foolhardy\"?  I would like to take the comments at face value, but hearing it so often has made me wonder if I'm missing something crucial, like an impatient chess player fiddling with a pawn not realizing his opponent is about to gobble up his queen.\r\n<h4>Signals<\/h4>\r\nHowever much I love this company, the signals all point in the same direction:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>I have been here for over seven years (in three different offices, sure, but that's a long time relative both to my working life and to my age).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I have just wrapped up the current project I moved from Tokyo to accomplish.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The person I hired and trained as my successor is more than ready for the role.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I had a number in mind when I started this job, and I hit it last November.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I want to take a year off to travel at some point in my life.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The opportunity cost is relatively low:  my salary is only going to get higher (making a year off in the future more expensive), and the credit crunch is likely to affect our bonuses (making this year the best one to miss a bonus, if I have to pick one).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The business team I work with is essentially the same as when I started -- a change will be refreshing.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Moving to a new internal role would mean a 2-3 year commitment in order to make a real difference, which is a long time to wait if I do want to take a sabbatical.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I'm more likely to get my next big increase in responsibility by moving externally than by moving internally.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I've got a big birthday in November, and would rather mark this year than subsequent ones.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I am ready for a new adventure.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4>Charts<\/h4>\r\nThere is yet another good reason to move.  I don't think folks in technology give this much thought, but their trajectory is different from that of the business team (this applies mainly to the \"partnerships\" we develop in finance -- if I were working for a technology firm, the following wouldn't be as relevant).  The IT \"earning curve\" starts off much higher than that of the typical business team member, but is flatter, which means that at some point, after more or less time being more valuable (as measured by compensation), technology is left in the dust.

The first jump in the business line is moving from graduate to FTE.  The jump in both lines between -3 and -2 is promotion to principal\/vice president.  The last data point for both series is just a continuation of the previous year's progression to make the trend more visible.  The red dot marks now, where the difference in values is currently just 2.3%.\r\n\r\nWhat this chart shows is that I have exactly this year captured the last of the alpha to be gained from opting for a career in technology.  In the next year or so my business counterparts will outpace me significantly and continue to accelerate.

The KAI reading comes from in that buy and sell are both pronounced the same:  \"bai\" (sounds almost the same as English \"buy\").

    "post_content": "I was chatting with a conversation partner who used \"88\" to sign off.  This turned out to be a numerical representation of a Chinese approximation of an English farewell:\r\n<blockquote>88 = 八八 ＝ bā bā = \"bye-bye\"<\/blockquote>\r\nBecause \"I\", \"you\", \"be\/am\/are\/is\" and \"love\" all have close approximations in Chinese digits, you can actually say a lot.  Some super-methodical person put up <a title=\"Chinese codes\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yellowbridge.com\/chinese\/pagercodes.php\" target=\"_blank\">this list of Chinese codes and their translations<\/a>.  My favorite is the self-refuting\r\n<blockquote>8006<span> <\/span>= 不理你了<span> <\/span>= \"Not paying attention to you anymore\"<\/blockquote>\r\nI learned today that in the local Shanghainese dialect a left turn is called a \"big turn\" (because you cross half the road) and a right turn is called a \"little turn\".\r\n\r\nIn class we learned buy (mǎi; 买) and sell (mài; 卖).  The characters differ only by one stroke and the pronunciation differs only in the tone.  I asked how traders confirm buys and sells on the phone, but our teacher didn't know.  I was at a CFA happy hour over the weekend with Andrew and we found a member who could tell us:  they add an extra character to each: \"buy in\" (买 进) and \"sell out\" (卖 出).",

    "post_content": "I concede that there is something slightly contradictory about having a to-do list for your time off, but one of my first steps after quitting was to make a list of things to accomplish during this sabbatical.  I realized today after reading <a title=\"Andrew Schwinger\" href=\"http:\/\/www.andrewschwinger.com\" target=\"_blank\">Schwinger<\/a>'s post, though, that these goals are actually projects, and as such deserve cool names.\r\n\r\nThe project getting the most attention when I was wrapping things up at work was related to TAXES, and was called Project TEXAS.  My advice was, Don't call it that.  At best, people will think you can do very simple anagrams.  At worst, they'll assume you're dyslexic.  In fact, as it turned out, the following conversation became common:\r\n<blockquote>— Oh, <em>TAXES<\/em>, I thought you were saying <em>TEXAS!<\/em>\r\n\r\n— I was, it's called Project Texas.\r\n\r\n— Sorry?<\/blockquote>\r\nIf you are impressed by the Texas\/taxes \"connection\", call it Project <a title=\"Texas is the Lone Star State\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Texas\" target=\"_blank\">Lone Star<\/a>, or Project Don't-Mess-With-Texas, or Project Longhorn.  (I am morally certain that Microsoft's Project Longhorn was named by or in honor of a UT-Austin alum.)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/texas.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-723\" title=\"texas\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/texas.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"103\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nOn one of my last days in London, I was walking through St. James's Square on my way to Green Park, and passed Norfolk House, the building in which the allies planned Operation Overlord.  Of course it's hard to separate the name from the history, but doesn't it give you chills?  All projects should have such cool names.\r\n\r\nI think Andrew understood this intuitively when he gave his own projects the following code names:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">PROJECT BLOOD-AXE<\/span><\/strong> <\/li>\r\n\t<li>PROJECT ROCKSTAR<\/li>\r\n\t<li>PROJECT HONGIAO<\/li>\r\n\t<li>PROJECT SKYHOOK<\/li>\r\n\t<li>PROJECT FISH MAMA<\/li>\r\n\t<li>PROJECT SCOOBIE DOO<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nSo I have also asked him to name my seven projects — I've provided the details and we'll see what he comes up with.\r\n\r\nIf your project has a silly, inappropriate, or namby-pamby name, feel free to send me a project initiation document, and I will get back to you with an appropriately cool project name either from my own background in mythology or from Schwinger's repertoire of smackdown-style designators.",

The exchanges were painless, and a big improvement over my attempts to navigate the city in my first two weeks.  The early attempts usually involved getting the hotel concierge to write my destination on a card in Chinese.\n\nI have several pages of notes on directions in Chinese, both cardinal directions (north, south, etc.) and taxi directions (left, right, stop here, you are going the wrong way).  The minimum fare in a Shanghai taxi costs only $2.00 and will take you all the way across town, so it's pretty cheap to practice.\n\nI learned yesterday that Chinese say \"Cold hands, warm heart\" just like we do.  Considering the telegraphic syntax, it could be originally Chinese.  This is just a way of saying that it's still cold here, in spite of today's sunny weather (the first sunny day in three weeks).",

    "post_content": "Several times in the past two days the same woman has pointed to the empty sidewalk in front of me, reached down and pretended to pick up a gold ring that she had been hiding in her hand.  The first time she gave it to me although I tried to decline it.  She showed me that it was too small to fit her (though that would mean it was certainly too small to fit me) and forced it on me.  Then she came back ten seconds later and asked for money.  I assume she probably has better luck with people who actually put the ring on (or ones who don't notice that she is conjuring the ring out of thin air).  Her \"office\" is around the Louvre, but she has so many customers, she didn't recognize me until she tried the trick for the third time.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/louvre.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1508  aligncenter\" title=\"louvre\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/louvre-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nIn Brazil I had a similar kind of trick played on me, also three times:  a guy points at your shoe, you look down to see that it is covered with bird guano.  The guy happens to have a shoeshine kit with him and cleans your dirty shoe for 5 reais, then asks for a tip to \"even them up\".  The first time this happened, I thought it was strange that I hadn't notice any birds or the mess on my shoe.  The second time it happened, I was sure that the shoeshine guy had fouled my shoe, but I didn't see how he did it.  The third time, I figured it out:  the guy points at your shoe, you look down and don't see anything.  You look back up at him and say, \"What?\".  While he's keeping his eyes locked on yours, he squirts the crud on your shoe and says, \"Look!\"  You look again and see the mess and convince yourself you just didn't notice it the first time.  I made the last guy clean my shoes for free — he denied several times that it was a scam, then finally confessed.\r\n\r\nThe virtue of his trick over the gypsy ring trick is that your shoes actually end up dirty and you have to do something about it.  The ring trick relies on a very feeble thread of obligation created when she offers the ring, and reinforced only slightly if you actually take it.\r\n\r\nThe best scam that I actually fell victim to was when someone entered my normally locked apartment complex and started ringing doorbells telling the upstairs people he was a downstairs neighbor and vice versa, asking for change to pay the pizza delivery guy.  I was suspicious, but as I was on slightly bad terms with my upstairs neighbor, having complained about the noise when he and his band held a full-volume rehearsal for seven hours on a Friday night, I thought I should make an investment in bridge-building.  After I closed the door I called the landlord and asked for a description of my upstairs neighbor.  It didn't match the guy at my door, but by that time he was gone.  That delayed suspicion was better than Ollie's, though — he came to my door about an hour later looking for his money and I had to tell him he had been conned.  His response:  \"The dirty dog!\"\r\n\r\nAfter that incident, I went and introduced myself to all my neighbors.  I also made a personal rule to look at all requests for money as simply requests for money — to ignore the story or trappings that surround the request and decide whether to give money for the sake of charity or in expectation of a return or repayment.  I think this has helped me avoid giving money in circumstances that play on the very natural inclination to be obliging, as with the (I suspect) false monk in Thailand.\r\n\r\n\"Don't cross a gypsy, boy\" is what the old bats in grey pea coats around Picadilly Circus curse you with if you don't let them put a flower in your buttonhole.  If you do let them, they hit you up for cash.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/orsay.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1509  aligncenter\" title=\"orsay\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/orsay-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>",

    "post_content": "I bought the Mandarin textbook that they use for the beginner's course at Jiao Tong and learned the first dialogue today. One of the challenges in learning Chinese is to memorize the tone for each word, but I've come up with a fool-proof method to learn tones in just a few seconds per word.\r\n\r\nSince the tone numbers (and even the tone symbols) are more or less arbitrary, you can substitute something more memorable for them. I assigned the following objects to visually represent the five tone contours in Mandarin Chinese (four tones plus \"unmarked\" tone):\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Tower<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Jet<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Swing<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Waterfall<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Pavement<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThe tower and pavement images are motionless because the tone contours they represent don't change. The others incorporate motion (imagine the jet taking off, the swing falling then rising from left to right, water plummeting down the waterfall).\r\n\r\nI also assigned colors to each object to give my memory another feature by which to \"index\" the tones and to let me use highlighter pens to flag ones I want to remember. Since any color association would also be arbitrary, I assigned the primary colors in ROYGBIV order (with one exception) to yield the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Red Tower<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Yellow Jet<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Green Swing (like Tarzan's)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Blue Waterfall<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Grey Pavement<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nPavement is the exception, but it's appropriate both because this symbol is supposed to represent no tone and grey is kind of a non-color, and because pavement is generally grey.\r\n\r\nTo remember a word's tone, mentally picture the word with the appropriate object (or combination of objects if it's a multi-syllable word). You can try it yourself: \"Horse\" in Chinese is mă, and it's the third tone. To remember the tone, create a mental \"story\" associating a horse with a swing. The crazier, sillier, more action-packed, or violent the image, the easier it is to remember, so don't just imagine a horse in a swing (though that is probably silly enough). Instead, put the horse in a latex suit, and put the swing in a circus, S&amp;M dungeon, or superhero training camp.\r\n\r\nThis idea owes a lot to <a title=\"Harry Lorraine\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Memory-Book-Classic-Improving-School\/dp\/0345337581\/ref=sr_1_2\/189-9798317-9177335?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1225684842&amp;sr=1-2\" target=\"_blank\">Harry Lorraine<\/a> and to <a title=\"James Heisig\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Remembering_the_Kanji_I\" target=\"_blank\">James Heisig<\/a>.",

    "post_content": "The reading, speaking, and listening courses at Jiao Tong all have their own textbooks.  The word total for all three is over 2400, but the set intersection is just 1163.  I compiled the word lists using <a title=\"CC-CEDICT\" href=\"http:\/\/www.mdbg.net\/chindict\/chindict.php?page=cedict\" target=\"_blank\">CC-CEDICT<\/a> and loaded them into jMemorize to run flashcards every morning and night for half an hour.  I'm in the (otherwise) segregated \"Asian\" class at Jiao Tong, and this is helping me keep up with the Japanese and Korean students who already know how to read and write fluently.\r\n\r\nI study using the English definition as my prompt.  I write out the pīnyīn and hànzì, then check what I've written against the result.  This way I test character recognition, pronunciation, tones and meaning in a single run.  A thirty minutes session is way more tiring than going to the gym.\r\n\r\nI ended up using <a title=\"jMemorize\" href=\"http:\/\/jmemorize.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">jMemorize<\/a> for three reasons:  importing my own word lists is relatively easy, I like the progress feedback you get when you promote or fail a word, and I like the built-in keyboard shortcuts for cycling through the cards.\r\n\r\nOther useful flashcard systems I looked at include the following <a title=\"Anki\" href=\"http:\/\/ichi2.net\/anki\/download\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Anki<\/a> and <a title=\"ZDT\" href=\"http:\/\/zdt.sourceforge.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">ZDT<\/a>.  I also tried Flash My Brain, but the import function deletes all the UTF-8 Chinese characters in my word lists, so it was useless for me.\r\n\r\nWhile I was looking around, I found <a title=\"Skritter\" href=\"http:\/\/www.skritter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Skritter<\/a>, a new site with a very cool interface to help test that you actually know how to write the words you are reviewing.  It even pronounces the words for you after you get them right.  The only problem for me is that it tests from pīnyīn rather than from English, and that it doesn't have the word sets for my books (yet).",

    "post_content": "I've been off work for the past two weeks, but today is officially my last day.  Not going into the office was surprisingly easy to get used to, but not getting paid is probably going to take more adjustment.\r\n\r\nI decided to take a sabbatical to do some traveling before moving to Shanghai to study Chinese.  Since I announced my decision, I've received a lot of kind notes and encouragement from friends and even relative strangers.  Many of them say that it is a brave thing to do.  Is that code for \"foolhardy\"?\r\n<h4>Signals<\/h4>\r\nHowever much I love this company, the signals all point in the same direction:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>I have been here for over seven years (in three different offices, sure, but that's a long time relative both to my working life and to my age).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I have just wrapped up the current project I moved from Tokyo to accomplish.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The person I hired and trained as my successor is more than ready for the role.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I had a number in mind when I started this job, and I hit it last November.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I want to take a year off to travel at some point in my life.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The opportunity cost is relatively low:  my salary is only going to get higher (making a year off in the future more expensive), and the credit crunch is likely to affect our bonuses (making this year the best one to miss a bonus, if I have to pick one).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The business team I work with is essentially the same as when I started -- a change will be refreshing.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Moving to a new internal role would mean a 2-3 year commitment in order to make a real difference, which is a long time to wait if I do want to take a sabbatical.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I'm more likely to get my next big increase in responsibility by moving externally than by moving internally.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I've got a big birthday in November, and would rather mark this year than subsequent ones.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I am ready for a new adventure.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4>Charts<\/h4>\r\nThere is yet another good reason to move.  I don't think folks in technology give this much thought, but their trajectory is different from that of the business team (this applies mainly to the \"partnerships\" we develop in finance -- if I were working for a technology firm, the following wouldn't be as relevant).  The IT \"earning curve\" starts off much higher than that of the typical business team member, but is flatter, which means that at some point, after more or less time being more valuable (as measured by compensation), technology is left in the dust.  Here's the chart:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-277\" title=\"Compensation Comparison\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/compcomp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"392\" height=\"320\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis graph is based on real data, but I obscured the actual numbers.  The first jump in the business line is moving from graduate to FTE.  The jump in both lines between -3 and -2 is promotion to principal\/vice president.  The last data point for both series is just a continuation of the previous year's progression to make the trend more visible.  The red dot marks now, where the difference in values is currently just 2.3%.\r\n\r\nWhat this chart shows is that I have exactly this year captured the last of the alpha to be gained from opting for a career in technology.  In the next year or so my business counterparts will outpace me significantly and continue to accelerate.  Saving \"turnabout is fair play\" and \"swings and roundabouts\" for a future discussion, there are two possible responses if I want to avoid this:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Stay on the same curve but increase my y-coordinate (e.g. by changing firms, which usually entails an increase in responsibility and compensation).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Look for a new curve (e.g., by moving to a business team or joining a technology company where I can contribute directly to the bottom line).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWhat is consistent in both alternatives is the need for a move.\r\n<h4>Signs<\/h4>\r\nFinally, there's the omen.  The day after I handed in my resignation, I talked to a friend of mine on the trading desk in Tokyo.  He said, \"You'll never guess what I did.  I resigned!  And you'll NEVER guess what I'm GOING to do.  I'm moving to Shanghai to study Chinese!\"\r\n\r\nTrying to time the market is a fool's game, but when your signals, your charts, and your buddy all tell you it's time to take a risk, it would be more foolish not to listen.",

I was talking with Manny last night about techniques for learning dialogues by heart, and thinking about the long road from here to fluency.  How do you know when you are fluent in a language?  Many people answer that question by saying, \"When you start dreaming in it.\"  Can that be the right answer?\r\n\r\nI've had dreams in which I can fly, but I don't think that means that I really can fly, or even that I know what it would feel like to be a bird or Superman.  That's part of the magic of dreams, you can have the feeling of doing something without the reality of it.\r\n\r\nI have a stronger reason to doubt the dream hypothesis:  I've dreamt that I could speak Ancient Greek.  After six years of study, I can read Homer and the early Platonic dialogues with not much effort, but I can't <em>speak<\/em> Ancient Greek.  And I had just started studying Greek in a summer intensive program when I had this dream, so I couldn't even read that much without a dictionary.\r\n\r\nI think that dreaming in a language is an indication that you are immersed in the language, but isn't necessarily a sign of fluency.  I also think that you probably gain fluency in different domains more quickly.  Many gaijin are fluent in \"Taxi Japanese\", and can get home from any part of the city, but many of them have no other Japanese language competence.\r\n\r\nI began to suspect that I was gaining general fluency in Japanese the day I got on the train at Shinjuku station, then immediately jumped off when the conductor announced that it would be an express train (which skips my station).

I was in the student cafeteria (the Mensa), testing bottles of soda to find a cold one.

    "post_content": "I've been off work for the past two weeks, but today is officially my last day.  Not going into the office was surprisingly easy to get used to, but not getting paid is probably going to take more adjustment.\r\n\r\nI decided to take a sabbatical to do some traveling before moving to Shanghai to study Chinese.  Since I announced my decision, I've received a lot of kind notes and encouragement from friends and even relative strangers.  Many of them say that it is a brave thing to do.  Is that code for \"foolhardy\"?\r\n<h4>Signals<\/h4>\r\nHowever much I love this company, the signals all point in the same direction:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>I have been here for over seven years (in three different offices, sure, but that's a long time relative both to my working life and to my age).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I have just wrapped up the current project I moved from Tokyo to accomplish.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The person I hired and trained as my successor is more than ready for the role.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I had a number in mind when I started this job, and I hit it last November.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I want to take a year off to travel at some point in my life.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The opportunity cost is relatively low:  my salary is only going to get higher (making a year off in the future more expensive), and the credit crunch is likely to affect our bonuses (making this year the best one to miss a bonus, if I have to pick one).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The business team I work with is essentially the same as when I started -- a change will be refreshing.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Moving to a new internal role would mean a 2-3 year commitment in order to make a real difference, which is a long time to wait if I do want to take a sabbatical.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I'm more likely to get my next big increase in responsibility by moving externally than by moving internally.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I've got a big birthday in November, and would rather mark this year than subsequent ones.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I am ready for a new adventure.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4>Charts<\/h4>\r\nThere is yet another good reason to move.  I don't think folks in technology give this much thought, but their trajectory is different from that of the business team (this applies mainly to the \"partnerships\" we develop in finance -- if I were working for a technology firm, the following wouldn't be as relevant).  The IT \"earning curve\" starts off much higher than that of the typical business team member, but is flatter, which means that at some point, after more or less time being more valuable (as measured by compensation), technology is left in the dust.  Here's the chart:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-277\" title=\"Compensation Comparison\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/compcomp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"392\" height=\"320\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis graph is based on real data, but I obscured the actual numbers.  The first jump in the business line is moving from graduate to FTE.  The jump in both lines between -3 and -2 is promotion to principal\/vice president.  The last data point for both series is just a continuation of the previous year's progression to make the trend more visible.  The red dot marks now, where the difference in values is currently just 2.3%.\r\n\r\nWhat this chart shows is that I have exactly this year captured the last of the alpha to be gained from opting for a career in technology.  In the next year or so my business counterparts will outpace me significantly and continue to accelerate.  Saving \"turnabout is fair play\" and \"swings and roundabouts\" for a future discussion, there are two possible responses if I want to avoid this:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Stay on the same curve but increase my y-coordinate (e.g. by changing firms, which usually entails an increase in responsibility and compensation).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Look for a new curve (e.g., by moving to a business team or joining a technology company where I can contribute directly to the bottom line).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWhat is consistent in both alternatives is the need for a move.\r\n<h4>Signs<\/h4>\r\nFinally, there's the omen.  The day after I handed in my resignation, I talked to a friend of mine on the trading desk in Tokyo.  He said, \"You'll never guess what I did.  I resigned!  And you'll NEVER guess what I'm GOING to do.  I'm moving to Shanghai to study Chinese!\"\r\n\r\nTrying to time the market is a fool's game, but when your signals, your charts, and your buddy all tell you it's time to take a risk, it would be more foolish not to listen.",

A pipe under the floor had burst and flooded my apartment and the downstairs neighbor's.  It took three or four days to fix, during which I had no water in my apartment (I showered at the gym).  When the crew were finished, there was an inch-thick layer of concrete dust over everything in my place.  It took a week to clean completely.  I was glad I had done the intensive studying early.\r\n\r\nThe day after everything was finally patched and cleaned, I went out to get my hair cut.  When I got back, the lock was broken.  The key turned, but the deadbolt wouldn't retract.  Four hours and $80 later I had a new deadbolt and three new keys.",

As I mentioned before I went on the trip, I had memorized 500 characters -- including pinyin, tones, and hanzi -- in a little over six weeks in class.  It seemed like I could do better, so when I got back, I started drilling even more.  A month later, I've completed the first-year textbooks and now know 875 characters.  At this pace it will only take...two years before I can read a newspaper.\r\n\r\nStudying so much every day really had an effect on my perception of characters.  I had a few interesting epiphanies, for example that the logos for China Telecom\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/ct.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1796  aligncenter\" title=\"ct\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/ct.png\" alt=\"ct\" width=\"59\" height=\"55\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/ct.png\"><\/a>and Bank of China\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/bc.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1797  aligncenter\" title=\"bc\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/bc.png\" alt=\"bc\" width=\"57\" height=\"56\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/bc.png\"><\/a>are both stylized versions of zhōng,\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/zh.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1798  aligncenter\" title=\"zh\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/zh.png\" alt=\"zh\" width=\"29\" height=\"35\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/zh.png\"><\/a>the character that represents the Middle Kingdom.

The China Telecom character is supposed to look like a globe, and also like the characters C and T (borrowed from Toyota's logo?).\r\n\r\nI had a bizarre experience while waiting for the elevator.  I was unconsciously counting along with the digital display as the elevator approached my floor:   15, 16, 17...

    "post_content": "Hunchun has over 300,000 people, but there are no Starbucks, McDonalds', KFC's or any other fast-food or convenience food chain.  All the signs are in Chinese, Korean, and Russian.  Everywhere we went people spoke to us in Russian.  At the karaoke place, the first song they put in was Korobeiniki, the song I think of as \"Tetris music\".\r\n\r\nThere are lots of taxis in Hunchun, and they honk at foreigners.  I walked a little over two miles to a Russian cake shop, and I don't think ten seconds went by without a cab honking at me.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1837\" title=\"russianmenu\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/08\/russianmenu-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"russianmenu\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe night we arrived, Li LiYan's family made us a feast with fish, chicken, and pork, an animal from each of the realms.  For breakfast the next morning we had meat dumplings.  For dinner we had barbecue, like DIY kushiyaki.  The only non-meat dishes were kimchi, and what I found at the cake shop.",

    "post_content": "\"Nostalgia\" is composed of two Greek words: the first means \"homecoming\" and the second means \"pain\". A year seemed like an impossibly generous amount of time to travel when I was setting out, but impossibly short when I was sitting on the beach in Bali at the end of it. Although there was a lot I missed about home, I thought I would never have the opportunity to take such a long trip again, and so decided to extend it for two more years.\r\n\r\nI returned to Shanghai and continued my Mandarin studies through 2010, traveling extensively in Asia to practice. I then took a year to do another full circumnavigation, this time including South America in the itinerary, and visiting all the scattered friends I hadn't yet seen in the first year of travel. After three years of travel, six years in Tokyo, three years in London, and studies in France, Germany, and Shanghai, I had lived abroad for 14 years. I was ready to come home.\r\n\r\nSome common objections to taking time off include worries that your skills will atrophy, that interviewers won't take you seriously, and that it will be hard to explain the \"gap\" in your resume.\r\n\r\nI think it is worth mentioning that exactly one person I spoke with did in fact embody all of these prejudices, but he was a rarity -- most people I met when I started thinking about employment again were both enthusiastic and intensely curious about the trip, and in at least one case (Amazon), it was the single most important factor in their interest. I don't know how many potential employers rejected my resume without contacting me, but within three months of starting my search I was in late-round interviews with Amazon, a bulge bracket bank in Manhattan, and two established startups in the fintech arena. I ended up choosing from multiple offers. I mention this for the benefit of people who might be contemplating their own extended trip -- you can come back!\r\n\r\nI took a job in Boston which had the benefit of being near my family in addition to giving me a chance to do extremely interesting work in analytics; but as is apparently my fate, after three years in Boston and a month after finally moving in to my own place in Cambridge, my new firm asked me to move to New York City. To borrow from Thoreau, \"at present I am a sojourner in civilized life again\", living happily on the Upper West Side for just over a year now, and very, very glad I took this trip.\r\n",

    "post_content": "I've been off work for the past two weeks, but today is officially my last day. Not going into the office was surprisingly easy to get used to, but not getting paid is probably going to take more adjustment.\r\n\r\nI decided to take a sabbatical to do some traveling before moving to Shanghai to study Chinese. Since I announced my decision, I've received a lot of kind notes and encouragement from friends and even relative strangers. Many of them say that it is a brave thing to do. Is that code for \"foolhardy\"?\r\n<h4>Signals<\/h4>\r\nHowever much I love this company, the signals all point in the same direction:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>I have been here for over seven years (in three different offices, sure, but that's a long time relative both to my working life and to my age).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I have just wrapped up the current project I moved from Tokyo to accomplish.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The person I hired and trained as my successor is more than ready for the role.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I had a number in mind when I started this job, and I hit it last November.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I want to take a year off to travel at some point in my life.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The opportunity cost is relatively low: my salary is only going to get higher (making a year off in the future more expensive), and the credit crunch is likely to affect our bonuses (making this year the best one to miss a bonus, if I have to pick one).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The business team I work with is essentially the same as when I started -- a change will be refreshing.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Moving to a new internal role would mean a 2-3 year commitment in order to make a real difference, which is a long time to wait if I do want to take a sabbatical.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I'm more likely to get my next big increase in responsibility by moving externally than by moving internally.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I've got a big birthday in November, and would rather mark this year than subsequent ones.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I am ready for a new adventure.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4>Charts<\/h4>\r\nThere is yet another good reason to move. I don't think folks in technology give this much thought, but their trajectory is different from that of the business team (this applies mainly to the \"partnerships\" we develop in finance -- if I were working for a technology firm, the following wouldn't be as relevant). The IT \"earning curve\" starts off much higher than that of the typical business team member, but is flatter, which means that at some point, after more or less time being more valuable (as measured by compensation), technology is left in the dust. Here's the chart:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-277\" title=\"Compensation Comparison\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/compcomp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"392\" height=\"320\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis graph is based on real data, but I obscured the actual numbers. The first jump in the business line is moving from graduate to FTE. The jump in both lines between -3 and -2 is promotion to principal\/vice president. The last data point for both series is just a continuation of the previous year's progression to make the trend more visible. The red dot marks now, where the difference in values is currently just 2.3%.\r\n\r\nWhat this chart shows is that I have exactly this year captured the last of the alpha to be gained from opting for a career in technology. In the next year or so my business counterparts will outpace me significantly and continue to accelerate. There are two possible responses if I want to avoid this:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Stay on the same curve but increase my y-coordinate (e.g. by changing firms, which usually entails an increase in responsibility and compensation).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Look for a new curve (e.g., by moving to a business team or joining a technology company where I can contribute directly to the bottom line).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWhat is consistent in both alternatives is the need for a move.\r\n<h4>Signs<\/h4>\r\nFinally, there's the omen. The day after I handed in my resignation, I talked to a friend of mine on the trading desk in Tokyo. He said, \"You'll never guess what I did. I resigned! And you'll NEVER guess what I'm GOING to do. I'm moving to Shanghai to study Chinese!\"\r\n\r\nIt's hard to time the market, but when your signals, your charts, and your friends all tell you it's time to take a risk, it would be foolish not to listen.",

    "post_content": "Hunchun has over 300,000 people, but there are no Starbucks, McDonalds', KFC's or any other fast-food or convenience food chain.  All the signs are in Chinese, Korean, and Russian.  Everywhere we went people spoke to us in Russian.  At the karaoke place, the first song they put in was Korobeiniki, the song I think of as \"Tetris music\".\r\n\r\nThere are lots of taxis in Hunchun, and they honk at foreigners.  I walked a little over two miles to a Russian cake shop, and I don't think ten seconds went by without a cab honking at me.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1837\" title=\"russianmenu\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/08\/russianmenu-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"russianmenu\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe night we arrived, Li LiYan's family made us a feast with fish, chicken, and pork, an animal from each of the realms.  For breakfast the next morning we had meat dumplings.  For dinner we had barbecue, like DIY kushiyaki.  The only non-meat dishes were kimchi, and what I found at the cake shop.",

    "post_content": "Haerbin is famous for having a standard Chinese accent.  Between that and the fact that almost no one speaks English, I think you could learn Chinese really quickly here.  The Korean signs disappear by the time you get to Haerbin, but Russian is everywhere.  Haerbin was originally a Russian settlement, as the cathedral attests:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/08\/cathedral.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1864\" title=\"cathedral\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/08\/cathedral-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"cathedral\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nDragon bollards for when you <em>really<\/em> want to discourage people from parking on the sidewalk:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/08\/dragon.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1865\" title=\"dragon\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/08\/dragon-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"dragon\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nOne night we were just walking down the street when two guys pulled their car to practice English with us.  One was an English teacher at the local high school, the other taught gym.  We chatted with them for about five minutes.  He wanted to know if I thought Haerbin was better than the US.  I said I thought Haerbin was great, and didn't mention that parts of it looked a little post-apocalyptic with downed power lines blocking the streets:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/08\/powerlines.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1867\" title=\"powerlines\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/08\/powerlines-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"powerlines\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nContinuing our meat-eating adventures, we went to a local restaurant that served fried ham hocks and other pork parts.  I believe we were the only foreigners ever to eat in this restaurant -- every single person stopped talking and stared at us as we walked to our table.  It's a big place too, at least a hundred customers.

I got into the elevator here in my apartment building and saw a couple already in there.  As I got on, the guy started saying to his wife, in Japanese,  \"Wow, look at him, he's really big.  Look how big he is!\"  After a few floors of this, I said, also in Japanese, \"Be careful, I can understand you.\"  He was surprised enough to blurt, \"あれ！”.  His wife didn't seem surprised (there are lots of expats in my building); she poked him in the stomach as a kind of reproach.",

    "post_content": "The days leading up to the eclipse on the 22nd were hot and sunny, with no clouds in the sky, but it was all just a big tease.  The clouds started rolling in on the evening of the 21st, and grew thicker and thicker through the night and the next morning until, just as the moon started to cross the disk of the sun, the clouds opened up and it started to rain.  Nick and Max had flown out to see the eclipse, so they must have been a little disappointed.  I just had to walk to the university track, but I was disappointed.

I think it would be a great place to study Chinese.  There is definitely an accent, but Taiwanese people speaking Mandarin are much easier to understand than Shanghainese speaking Mandarin.\r\n\r\nThe night before we left, we went to a party at a club called LAN in Shanghai, and met some Taiwanese who suggested the National Palace Museum as a good place to visit.  So we went there, to the huge memorials to Sun Yat-Sen and Chiang Kai-Shek, and we wandered out west to the river to see the local temples, all of which had intricate carved dragons at the entrance.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/08\/tower.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1941\" title=\"tower\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/08\/tower-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"tower\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nWe went to the top of the 101 building to see the view.  There is a mediocre restaurant up there, where we had something to drink while we looked out at the lights of the much smaller buildings below.  The 101 building is higher than both the JinMao Tower and the Shanghai World Financial Center, but it seems a little lonely without any friends around.\r\n\r\nAt Mike's party, all but one of the guys were entrepreneurs.  One (25 years old) owned a frozen yogurt shop, one ran a television channel, one imported wine, another imported prepared foods and exported tea.  Even at the LAN party, many of the people were entrepreneurs, including a former banker who now owns a gallery in New York, and a former lawyer who makes handbags.",

I got a suit made two trips ago, got it fitted today, and will take it home after the Hong Kong trip.  The lining is blue silk dragons.  Who knows how long it will last, but I calculated that for the price of the last suit I bought in London, I could have 50 (fifty!) suits handmade in Shanghai.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/08\/suit.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1956\" title=\"suit\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/08\/suit-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"suit\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\n\nI also got some shirts made, and some linen trousers.\n\nAfterward, we've been going to the NanXiang Steamed Bun Restaurant for xiaolongbao.

    "post_content": "The Shanghai Museum is free, and I've been taking advantage of it to go during the week and just see one room at a time.  Coins, pottery, bronzes, jade.  It's much more fun to take some time to look at one batch of objects than to try to see everything in two hours (my limit before I get tired of shuffling around).\r\n\r\nThis is the jade I liked best, it looks like a little Ebisu-sama, the Japanese god of wealth who is always depicted with a fish:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/08\/ebisu.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1992\" title=\"ebisu\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/08\/ebisu-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"ebisu\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nIf you go to the Shanghai Museum and a young couple or a group of students asks you to take their picture in front of the museum, you might want to say no.  Since I was going every day for a while, I got asked regularly and noticed the same people -- who needs that many pictures of themselves?  I searched for \"people's park scam\" and found many reports of students inviting foreigners to tea, then asking them to pay the inflated bill, claiming to be poor students.\r\n\r\nIt feels rude to decline to take a photo, but the last day before I read up on this, I took four photos on my way through the park.  No big deal if you're only going once, but tedious if you're going regularly.",

    "post_content": "We went out Friday night in Hong Kong and were up late into the 4th of July Saturday.  We had a couple of friends showing us around the bars of Lan Kwai Fong, then a club called Privée, and another called Beijing.  The last two were extremely crowded even though it was almost four in the morning.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1929  aligncenter\" title=\"wwjd\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/wwjd.jpeg\" alt=\"wwjd\" width=\"101\" height=\"126\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\nAnyway, the highlight of the evening was that I got into a fight with a group of guys in the club called Beijing.  Basically they started pointing fingers and yelling, then one guy tried to kick me, then the rest jumped in.  They didn't make a coordinated effort, instead they sort of presented themselves one at a time and tried to hit or kick me.  This was lucky for me because with the strobe light on and the music going, it was very hard for me to tell which of the people in the crowd were part of the group trying to get me.  Chris was there but didn't see what was happening, so I had no backup.\r\n\r\nI ended up with a bruised forearm (from blocking a kick to the head!), and a bruised shin (one guy kicked me in the shin when the strobe light went out), but I didn't get hurt otherwise.  I also didn't hurt anyone badly.  My kung fu was stronger than their kung fu, and I was a lot bigger.\r\n\r\nThe management came finally, threw those guys out after some discussion, and bought us champagne.  I asked if this sort of thing happens regularly, and they said, \"Some locals just don't like <em>gweilo<\/em>.\"\r\n\r\nUpdate:  Andrew went to Hong Kong in August and was harassed by a non-local for being American.  I think Hong Kong is just a little more aggressive than Shanghai.",

    "post_content": "Last night was my leaving do\/going away party in Shoreditch, and today was my last day at work.  I came in just to say goodbye and give back my ID card and blackberry (my badge and gun).  After two years of being on call, I wasn't sorry to give up the blackberry, but after more than seven years at the company, it was a little sad to ask the guard to open the gate and let me out.\r\n\r\nAndy and Mechelle took me to lunch with them at the Walrus and Carpenter.  I ordered steak and ale pie in short pastry and mentioned that when I moved to London, I imagined I would be eating like this all the time.  Andy said don't stereotype the English.  I said if I were stereotyping, I would have ordered a curry, a lager, and a punch-up.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch I walked back to The Light to pick up my credit card and pay my tab from the night before (I forgot this when we wobbled out to the second venue).\r\n\r\nNext I went to the post office and mailed my passport to the US Embassy here in London to get it renewed (that takes some faith!).  I had added some new pages two years ago, but on my trip to Ireland last month, the immigration officer used up the (entire) last clean page.  The website says it will take 15 days, so (fingers crossed) I will have it back before my flight leaves on September 1.\r\n\r\nWhen I got home, I disabled the script that plays music to wake me up in the morning -- I still don't quite believe it, but I won't need to get up regularly at any certain time for the next year at least.",

    "post_content": "I've been off work for the past two weeks, but today is officially my last day.  Not going into the office was surprisingly easy to get used to, but not getting paid is probably going to take more adjustment.\r\n\r\nI decided to take a sabbatical to do some traveling before moving to Shanghai to study Chinese.  Since I announced my decision, I've received a lot of kind notes and encouragement from friends and even relative strangers.  Many of them say that it is a brave thing to do.  Is that code for \"foolhardy\"?\r\n<h4>Signals<\/h4>\r\nHowever much I love this company, the signals all point in the same direction:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>I have been here for over seven years (in three different offices, sure, but that's a long time relative both to my working life and to my age).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I have just wrapped up the current project I moved from Tokyo to accomplish.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The person I hired and trained as my successor is more than ready for the role.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I had a number in mind when I started this job, and I hit it last November.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I want to take a year off to travel at some point in my life.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The opportunity cost is relatively low:  my salary is only going to get higher (making a year off in the future more expensive), and the credit crunch is likely to affect our bonuses (making this year the best one to miss a bonus, if I have to pick one).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The business team I work with is essentially the same as when I started -- a change will be refreshing.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Moving to a new internal role would mean a 2-3 year commitment in order to make a real difference, which is a long time to wait if I do want to take a sabbatical.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I'm more likely to get my next big increase in responsibility by moving externally than by moving internally.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I've got a big birthday in November, and would rather mark this year than subsequent ones.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I am ready for a new adventure.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4>Charts<\/h4>\r\nThere is yet another good reason to move.  I don't think folks in technology give this much thought, but their trajectory is different from that of the business team (this applies mainly to the \"partnerships\" we develop in finance -- if I were working for a technology firm, the following wouldn't be as relevant).  The IT \"earning curve\" starts off much higher than that of the typical business team member, but is flatter, which means that at some point, after more or less time being more valuable (as measured by compensation), technology is left in the dust.  Here's the chart:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-277\" title=\"Compensation Comparison\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/compcomp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"392\" height=\"320\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis graph is based on real data, but I obscured the actual numbers.  The first jump in the business line is moving from graduate to FTE.  The jump in both lines between -3 and -2 is promotion to principal\/vice president.  The last data point for both series is just a continuation of the previous year's progression to make the trend more visible.  The red dot marks now, where the difference in values is currently just 2.3%.\r\n\r\nWhat this chart shows is that I have exactly this year captured the last of the alpha to be gained from opting for a career in technology.  In the next year or so my business counterparts will outpace me significantly and continue to accelerate.  Saving \"turnabout is fair play\" and \"swings and roundabouts\" for a future discussion, there are two possible responses if I want to avoid this:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Stay on the same curve but increase my y-coordinate (e.g. by changing firms, which usually entails an increase in responsibility and compensation).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Look for a new curve (e.g., by moving to a business team or joining a technology company where I can contribute directly to the bottom line).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWhat is consistent in both alternatives is the need for a move.\r\n<h4>Signs<\/h4>\r\nFinally, there's the omen.  The day after I handed in my resignation, I talked to a friend of mine on the trading desk in Tokyo.  He said, \"You'll never guess what I did.  I resigned!  And you'll NEVER guess what I'm GOING to do.  I'm moving to Shanghai to study Chinese!\"\r\n\r\nTrying to time the market is a fool's game, but when your signals, your charts, and your buddy all tell you it's time to take a risk, it would be more foolish not to listen.",

We had a couple of friends showing us around the bars of Lan Kwai Fong, then a club called Privée, and another called Beijing.  The last two were extremely crowded even though it was almost four in the morning.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1929  aligncenter\" title=\"wwjd\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/wwjd.jpeg\" alt=\"wwjd\" width=\"101\" height=\"126\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\nAnyway, the highlight of the evening was that I got into a fight with a group of guys in the club called Beijing.  Basically they started pointing fingers and yelling, then one guy tried to kick me, then the rest jumped in.  They didn't make a coordinated effort, instead they sort of presented themselves one at a time and tried to hit or kick me.  This was lucky for me because with the strobe light on and the music going, it was very hard for me to tell which of the people in the crowd were part of the group trying to get me.  Chris was there but didn't see what was happening, so I had no backup.\r\n\r\nI ended up with a bruised forearm (from blocking a kick to the head!), and a bruised shin (one guy kicked me in the shin when the strobe light went out), but I didn't get hurt otherwise.  I also didn't hurt anyone badly.  My kung fu was stronger than their kung fu, and I was a lot bigger.\r\n\r\nThe management came finally, threw those guys out after some discussion, and bought us champagne.  I asked if this sort of thing happens regularly, and they said, \"Some locals just don't like <em>gweilo<\/em>.\"\r\n\r\nUpdate:  Andrew went to Hong Kong in August and was harassed by a non-local for being American.

They didn't make a coordinated effort, instead they sort of presented themselves one at a time and tried to hit or kick me.  This was lucky for me because with the strobe light on and the music going, it was very hard for me to tell which of the people in the crowd were part of the group trying to get me.  Chris was there but didn't see what was happening, so couldn't help.\r\n\r\nI ended up with a bruised forearm (from blocking a kick to the head!), and a bruised shin (one guy kicked me in the shin when the strobe light went out), but I didn't get hurt otherwise, even though there were four of them.  My kung fu was stronger than their kung fu, and I was a lot bigger.\r\n\r\nThe management came finally, threw those guys out after some discussion, and bought us champagne.  I asked if this sort of thing happens regularly, and they said, \"Some locals just don't like <em>gweilo<\/em>.\"\r\n\r\nUpdate:  Andrew went to Hong Kong in August and was harassed by a non-local for being American.  I think Hong Kong is just a little more aggressive than Shanghai.",

    "post_content": "On July 3, we walked across the border to Hong Kong.  You have to fill out two or three forms on each side, and there is this no-man's land in the middle where you've filled out all your forms to leave China and haven't filled out any to be admitted to Hong Kong yet.\r\n\r\nOn the Hong Kong side, you can just get on the metro and ride in to Central.\r\n\r\nWe stayed for the first few nights on Ice House Street, which is right in Central, close to where I met Tibor and Eric for drinks on the roof of Prince's Building.  For the rest of the trip, we stayed at the YMCA in Kowloon, which has a spectacular view.\r\n\r\n[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"2\" orderby=\"post_name\"]\r\n\r\nLooking at a trilingual map, I saw that the simplified Chinese for Kowloon is 九龙, which means \"Nine Dragons\".  Dragon wouldn't be a very useful word to learn in English, but it's very handy in Chinese.\r\n\r\nWe went to see a New York comedian named Ted Alexandro for a very funny show, and made it to Lan Kwai Fong or Wan Chai most of the nights we were there.\r\n\r\nHong Kong, like Singapore, is small enough that you can run into people you know randomly.  We were there for just ten days, but it happened several times.",

I had planned on renting Heroes, watching the Sopranos through to the finale, and playing some video games.  Manny's pad in Covent Garden has all the important mod cons:  42\" plasma TV, Xbox, Wii <strong>and<\/strong> PS3.  Why wait?\r\n\r\nWe bought Grand Theft Auto IV on Wednesday and it took until just after midnight to learn to drive, fight, shoot and take the Michelle character out on dates.  On Thursday I played from about 2:00p until I had acquired a set of body armor, a knife, a pistol, a shotgun and a police car about six hours later.  Then we were ready to really start playing.\r\n\r\nMost days we've been up until around 1:00a playing, and that was exercising real discipline.  I'm not sure that playing a violent game like GTA makes you more likely to commit violent acts in real life, but I know that after playing for three solid days it does affect your perception.  In the game, if you beat up or run over a character, any cash he has falls out of his pockets and glows green.  I was walking down Neal Street on Friday and saw a fluorescent green plastic spoon from the local gelato place glowing in the sun on the cobblestones.  My first thought was, \"Ooh, money.\"",

    "post_content": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">On my flight home to Tokyo from my last trip to Bangkok, Thai Airways invited monks to board first before making the usual announcement about \"guests traveling with small children and people needing extra time.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When I got to the counter I asked why and they told me that monks are not allowed to touch women, and letting them board first helps keep them from getting accidentally jostled.  Apparently it works the same on the metro:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/monkseat.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1306  aligncenter\" title=\"monkseat\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/monkseat-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nI wonder if monks are allowed to touch ladyboys.\r\n\r\nWhile walking down Sukhumvit Road, I've been approached on two occasions by a man wearing saffron monk robes.  He was very aggressive in asking for money, and singled me out of a host of Thai people walking down the same street.  I didn't give him any money for several small reasons:  He was wearing street shoes, not sandals; he singled me (the foreigner) out, which I didn't want to encourage; he was out begging in the early evening and I had read that monks were meant to live on alms they collected each day before noon.\r\n\r\nI understand that all Thai men are monks at some stage in their lives, even if it's only for one day.  It seems to me that the point of living from alms is to learn humility and self-denial, and to understand your interdependence with other members of your community.  You can't learn these things by begging from tourists (presumably because they have more money) rather than your co-religionists.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I read this excerpt from the Diamond Sutra quoted in Paul Theroux's <em>Ghost Train To The Eastern Star<\/em> yesterday:\r\n<blockquote>Buddha teaches that the mind of a Bodhisattva should not accept the appearances of things as a basis when exercising charity.<\/blockquote>",

    "post_content": "\"Nostalgia\" is composed of two Greek words: the first means \"homecoming\" and the second means \"pain\". A year seemed like an impossibly generous amount of time to travel when I was setting out, but impossibly short when I was sitting on the beach in Bali at the end of it. Although there was a lot I missed about home, I thought I would never have the opportunity to take such a long trip again, and so decided to extend it for two more years.\r\n\r\nI returned to Shanghai and continued my Mandarin studies through 2010, traveling extensively in Asia to practice. I then took a year to do another full circumnavigation, this time including South America in the itinerary, and visiting all the scattered friends I hadn't yet seen in the first year of travel. After three years of travel, six years in Tokyo, three years in London, and studies in France, Germany, and Shanghai, I had lived abroad for 14 years. I was ready to come home.\r\n\r\nSome common objections to taking time off include worries that your skills will atrophy, that interviewers won't take you seriously, and that it will be hard to explain the \"gap\" in your resume.\r\n\r\nI think it is worth mentioning that exactly one person I spoke with did in fact embody all of these prejudices, but he was a rarity -- most people I met when I started thinking about employment again were both enthusiastic and intensely curious about the trip, and in at least one case (Amazon), it was the single most important factor in their interest. I don't know how many potential employers rejected my resume without contacting me, but within three months of starting my search I was in late-round interviews with Amazon, a bulge bracket bank in Manhattan, and two established startups in the fintech arena. I ended up choosing from multiple offers. I mention this for the benefit of people who might be contemplating their own extended trip -- you can come back!\r\n\r\nI took a job in Boston which had the benefit of being near my family in addition to giving me a chance to do extremely interesting work in analytics; but as is apparently my fate, after three years in Boston and a month after finally moving in to my own place in Cambridge, my new firm asked me to move to New York City. To borrow from Thoreau, \"at present I am a sojourner in civilized life again\", living happily in  Manhattan for just over a year now, and very, very glad I took this trip.\r\n",

    "post_content": "We went out Friday night in Hong Kong and were up late into the 4th of July Saturday.  We had a couple of friends showing us around the bars of Lan Kwai Fong, then a club called Privée, and another called Beijing.  The last two were extremely crowded even though it was almost four in the morning.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1929  aligncenter\" title=\"wwjd\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/wwjd.jpeg\" alt=\"wwjd\" width=\"101\" height=\"126\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\nAnyway, the highlight of the evening was that I got into a fight with a group of guys in the club called Beijing.  Basically they started pointing fingers and yelling, then one guy tried to kick me, then the rest jumped in.  They didn't make a coordinated effort, instead they sort of presented themselves one at a time and tried to hit or kick me.  This was lucky for me because with the strobe light on and the music going, it was very hard for me to tell which of the people in the crowd were part of the group trying to get me.  Chris was there but didn't see what was happening, so couldn't help.\r\n\r\nI ended up with a bruised forearm (from blocking a kick to the head!), and a bruised shin (one guy kicked me in the shin when the strobe light went out), but I didn't get hurt otherwise, even though there were four of them.  My kung fu was stronger than their kung fu, and I was a lot bigger.\r\n\r\nThe management came finally, threw those guys out after some discussion, and bought us champagne.  I asked if this sort of thing happens regularly, and they said, \"Some locals just don't like <em>gweilo<\/em>.\"\r\n",

    "post_content": "I've been off work for the past two weeks, but today is officially my last day.  Not going into the office was surprisingly easy to get used to, but not getting paid is probably going to take more adjustment.\r\n\r\nI decided to take a sabbatical to do some traveling before moving to Shanghai to study Chinese.  Since I announced my decision, I've received a lot of kind notes and encouragement from friends and even relative strangers.  Many of them say that it is a brave thing to do.  Is that code for \"foolhardy\"?\r\n<h4>Signals<\/h4>\r\nHowever much I love this company, the signals all point in the same direction:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>I have been here for over seven years (in three different offices, sure, but that's a long time relative both to my working life and to my age).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I have just wrapped up the current project I moved from Tokyo to accomplish.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The person I hired and trained as my successor is more than ready for the role.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I had a number in mind when I started this job, and I hit it last November.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I want to take a year off to travel at some point in my life.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The opportunity cost is relatively low:  my salary is only going to get higher (making a year off in the future more expensive), and the credit crunch is likely to affect our bonuses (making this year the best one to miss a bonus, if I have to pick one).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The business team I work with is essentially the same as when I started -- a change will be refreshing.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Moving to a new internal role would mean a 2-3 year commitment in order to make a real difference, which is a long time to wait if I do want to take a sabbatical.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I'm more likely to get my next big increase in responsibility by moving externally than by moving internally.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I've got a big birthday in November, and would rather mark this year than subsequent ones.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I am ready for a new adventure.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4>Charts<\/h4>\r\nThere is yet another good reason to move.  I don't think folks in technology give this much thought, but their trajectory is different from that of the business team (this applies mainly to the \"partnerships\" we develop in finance -- if I were working for a technology firm, the following wouldn't be as relevant).  The IT \"earning curve\" starts off much higher than that of the typical business team member, but is flatter, which means that at some point, after more or less time being more valuable (as measured by compensation), technology is left in the dust.  Here's the chart:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-277\" title=\"Compensation Comparison\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/compcomp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"392\" height=\"320\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis graph is based on real data, but I obscured the actual numbers.

    "post_content": "I've been off work for the past two weeks, but today is officially my last day.  Not going into the office was surprisingly easy to get used to, but not getting paid is probably going to take more adjustment.\r\n\r\nI decided to take a sabbatical to do some traveling before moving to Shanghai to study Chinese.  Since I announced my decision, I've received a lot of kind notes and encouragement from friends and even relative strangers.  Many of them say that it is a brave thing to do.  Is that code for \"foolhardy\"?\r\n<h4>Signals<\/h4>\r\nHowever much I love this company, the signals all point in the same direction:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>I have been here for over seven years (in three different offices, sure, but that's a long time relative both to my working life and to my age).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I have just wrapped up the current project I moved from Tokyo to accomplish.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The person I hired and trained as my successor is more than ready for the role.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I had a number in mind when I started this job, and I hit it last November.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I want to take a year off to travel at some point in my life.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The opportunity cost is relatively low:  my salary is only going to get higher (making a year off in the future more expensive), and the credit crunch is likely to affect our bonuses (making this year the best one to miss a bonus, if I have to pick one).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The business team I work with is essentially the same as when I started -- a change will be refreshing.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Moving to a new internal role would mean a 2-3 year commitment in order to make a real difference, which is a long time to wait if I do want to take a sabbatical.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I'm more likely to get my next big increase in responsibility by moving externally than by moving internally.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I've got a big birthday in November, and would rather mark this year than subsequent ones.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I am ready for a new adventure.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4>Charts<\/h4>\r\nThere is yet another good reason to move.  I don't think folks in technology give this much thought, but their trajectory is different from that of the business team (this applies mainly to the \"partnerships\" we develop in finance -- if I were working for a technology firm, the following wouldn't be as relevant).  The IT \"earning curve\" starts off much higher than that of the typical business team member, but is flatter, which means that at some point, after more or less time being more valuable (as measured by compensation), technology is left in the dust.  Here's the chart:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-277\" title=\"Compensation Comparison\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/compcomp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"392\" height=\"320\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis graph is based on real data, but I obscured the actual numbers.  The first jump in the business line is moving from graduate to FTE.  The jump in both lines between -3 and -2 is promotion to principal\/vice president.  The last data point for both series is just a continuation of the previous year's progression to make the trend more visible.  The red dot marks now, where the difference in values is currently just 2.3%.\r\n\r\nWhat this chart shows is that I have exactly this year captured the last of the alpha to be gained from opting for a career in technology.  In the next year or so my business counterparts will outpace me significantly and continue to accelerate.  Saving \"turnabout is fair play\" and \"swings and roundabouts\" for a future discussion, there are two possible responses if I want to avoid this:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Stay on the same curve but increase my y-coordinate (e.g. by changing firms, which usually entails an increase in responsibility and compensation).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Look for a new curve (e.g., by moving to a business team or joining a technology company where I can contribute directly to the bottom line).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWhat is consistent in both alternatives is the need for a move.\r\n<h4>Signs<\/h4>\r\nFinally, there's the omen.  The day after I handed in my resignation, I talked to a friend of mine on the trading desk in Tokyo.  He said, \"You'll never guess what I did.  I resigned!  And you'll NEVER guess what I'm GOING to do.

There are plenty of great photos of Pudong and such on the web (click the links above), but what you don't see are all the construction cranes.  With all the construction in Dubai, London, and China, I think renting construction cranes must be a good business to be in right now.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1089 aligncenter\" title=\"pudongcranes\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/pudongcranes-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\nAt XinTianDi, we had a beer at the Paulaner Brewery, which was a slightly surreal experience after just leaving Oktoberfest in Munich -- the same brewery as our Oktoberfest tent, the same Bavarian costumes but worn by Chinese staff, beer in pint glasses instead of liters, and the <a title=\"Dirndl\" href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/boblog\/dirndl\/\" target=\"_self\">dirndls<\/a> suffering similar capacity issues, as a witty friend noted.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/paulaner.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1094 aligncenter\" title=\"paulaner\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/paulaner-292x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"292\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nWe went to Glamour Bar and then another recommendation across the street called Jean Georges.  Glamour Bar was crowded and got even more crowded as the night went on — we thought we might bring down the tone with our T-shirts and jeans, but there were guys in there wearing shorts.  Shanghai seems fairly casual about dress codes.  Jean Georges was empty, but was slightly more pleasant than Glamour Bar, which is a little tatty, like Tableaux in Tokyo's Daikanyama — you get the feeling it's been around a while.  The bar at Jean Georges doesn't have a view of Pudong, though, so can't really compete.",

It seemed like I could do better, so when I got back, I started drilling even more.  A month later, I've completed the first-year textbooks and now know 875 characters.  At this pace it will only take...two years before I can read a newspaper.\r\n\r\nStudying so much every day really had an effect on my perception of characters.

    "post_content": "We went out Friday night in Hong Kong and were up late into the 4th of July Saturday.  We had a couple of friends showing us around the bars of Lan Kwai Fong, then a club called Privée, and another called Beijing.  The last two were extremely crowded even though it was almost four in the morning.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1929  aligncenter\" title=\"wwjd\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/wwjd.jpeg\" alt=\"wwjd\" width=\"101\" height=\"126\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\nAnyway, the highlight of the evening was that I got into a fight with a group of guys in the club called Beijing.  Basically they started pointing fingers and yelling, then one guy tried to kick me, then the rest jumped in.  They didn't make a coordinated effort, instead they sort of presented themselves one at a time and tried to hit or kick me.  This was lucky for me because with the strobe light on and the music going, it was very hard for me to tell which of the people in the crowd were part of the group trying to get me.  Chris was there but didn't see what was happening, so couldn't help.\r\n\r\nI ended up with a bruised forearm (from blocking a kick to the head!), and a bruised shin (one guy kicked me in the shin when the strobe light went out), but I didn't get hurt otherwise, even though there were four of them, and I didn't have to hurt anyone badly.  My kung fu was stronger than their kung fu, and I was a lot bigger.\r\n\r\nThe management came finally, threw those guys out after some discussion, and bought us champagne.  I asked if this sort of thing happens regularly, and they said, \"Some locals just don't like <em>gweilo<\/em>.\"\r\n",

It's not that lazy, dumb people can't get that degree but that they wouldn't want to:  employers will pay philosophy graduates enough to compensate them for the trouble but not enough to persuade lazy, dumb people to bother.

A friend of mine was studying for a mid-term in a course called Gemstones and Gemology.  I said, \"Are you really going to get college credit for a course on jewelry?\"  She came back with, \"What are you studying?  Aristotle?  What use is that to anybody?\"  So I bet her that I could take the practice exam she was working on and that Aristotle would help me do better than she had after three months of lectures on the subject.\r\n\r\nI took the test.  Not only did I beat my friend's score, I got everything right.  Why?  Aristotle is the foundation of western science.  If you understand Aristotle, you understand how scientific problems are formulated.  In addition, since he started the tradition and his disciples continue it, much of scientific terminology is in Greek or Latin.  I don't have to take a class to tell me what \"anisotropic\" means -- the word itself tells me, and I can guess from it (for example) that anisotropic gems split light in different directions.  (This sort of thing is why it's still worth studying Greek*, even for the pragmatically minded.)  Finally, as the founder of syllogistic logic, Aristotle gives insight into contradictions that allow a test-taker to eliminate incorrect options and to see how questions later in the exam illuminate earlier ones.\r\n\r\nThis is a roundabout way of objecting to the assertion that philosophy \"does not improve the candidate's productivity\".  I think philosophy, like mathematics or other problem-solving disciplines, does increase productivity by giving students tools to analyze problems and to accelerate learning.

    "post_content": "With Chinese, I'm still at the rote memorization stage.  I was talking with Manny last night about techniques for learning dialogues by heart, and thinking about the long road from here to fluency.  How do you know when you are fluent in a language?  Many people answer that question by saying, \"When you start dreaming in it.\"  Can that be the right answer?\r\n\r\nI've had dreams in which I can fly, but I don't think that means that I really can fly, or even that I know what it would feel like to be a bird or Superman.  That's part of the magic of dreams, you can have the feeling of doing something without the reality of it.\r\n\r\nI have a stronger reason to doubt the dream hypothesis:  I've dreamt that I could speak Ancient Greek.  After six years of study, I can read Homer and the early Platonic dialogues with not much effort, but I can't <em>speak<\/em> Ancient Greek.  And I had just started studying Greek in a summer intensive program when I had this dream, so I couldn't even read that much without a dictionary.\r\n\r\nI think that dreaming in a language is an indication that you are immersed in the language, but isn't necessarily a sign of fluency.  I also think that you probably gain fluency in different domains more quickly.  Many gaijin are fluent in \"Taxi Japanese\", and can get home from any part of the city, but have no other Japanese language competence.\r\n\r\nI began to suspect that I was gaining general fluency in Japanese the day I got on the train at Shinjuku station, then immediately jumped off when the conductor announced that it would be an express train (which skips my station).  I didn't have time to reflect on or translate the announcement -- I reacted to the words subconsciously.\r\n\r\nIn France, I met an apple farmer during a bike ride to Mont-Saint-Michel.  After some minutes of conversation, he asked if I were Breton.  No one would mistake me for French (there are not many 6'4\" blond Frenchmen), but to be mistaken for the Celtic minority of Bretagne made me realize my studying had paid off.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, a good comeback made me feel like I had reached a degree of fluency in everyday conversation.  I was in the student cafeteria (the Mensa), testing bottles of soda to find a cold one.  I finally took one from the back of the rack, and the server scolded me in German:  \"They are all the same!\"  I replied without thinking, also in German:  \"Then it doesn't matter which one I take, does it?\"",

The abstinent can choose from Tea Trade Wharf or Water Gardens.  And the rest?  The index goes from \"Bee Passage\" to \"Beeston Close\":  No Beer.  No Lager, no Stout.  No Pint.  But not to despair:  for the impatient tippler there is a Wine Close.",

    "post_content": "Since all of my time is currently free time, I've been spending a lot of it in parks and pubs, and \"measuring out my life with coffee spoons\" in cafes.  Sometimes, I get to talk to strangers.\r\n\r\nI was in the Crown and Anchor, writing in my journal, when a woman sat next to me, ordered a pint, and opened Bertrand Russell's <em>A History of Western Philosophy<\/em>.  I assumed she was a philosophy student (as I was myself once), because of the book and because she was somewhat scruffy.  She asked me to watch her stuff for a minute, and when she got back I asked her if she was carrying that heavy tome for self-defense on the mean streets of London, or if it was for a course.  It turns out she's doing a philosophy degree at UCL.\r\n\r\nIt may be that reading technique has declined since I was a student:  hers involved moving her head side-to-side as if she were watching a miniature tennis match taking place on the pages of her book.  I got the impression from this that the book was a little bit for show, and that she was absorbing more beer than Bertrand.  Philosophy students weren't pretentious back in my day, oh no.\r\n\r\nFor laughs, I was tempted to ask, \"What are you going to do with a degree in philosophy?\"  I didn't, as I know from experience how annoying that question can be.  Instead, I confessed that I had done a degree in philosophy, followed shortly by another.  I should have added, \"And now I'm unemployed.\"\r\n\r\nI'm reading <em>The Undercover Economist<\/em> (which itself struggles with pretension); it had this analysis of the value of philosophy degrees:\r\n<blockquote>Spence himself first used his insight to show why students might choose to pursue a degree in philosophy, which is difficult but does not lead to specific career opportunities, like an economics degree or a marketing degree.  Assume that employers would like to hire smart, diligent workers but can't tell from an interview who is smart or diligent.  Assume also that everyone has to work hard to obtain a philosophy degree, but lazy, dumb people find it particularly troublesome.\r\n\r\nSpence then shows that smart, diligent people can prove they're smart and diligent by going to the trouble of getting a philosophy degree.  It's not that lazy, dumb people can't get that degree but that they wouldn't want to:  employers will pay philosophy graduates enough to compensate them for the trouble but not enough to persuade lazy, dumb people to bother.  The employers are willing to do this despite the fact that the philosophy degree itself does not improve the candidate's productivity at all.  It is merely a credible signal, because a philosophy degree is too much trouble for lazy, dumb people to acquire.<\/blockquote>\r\nIs this an accurate analysis?  A friend of mine was studying for a mid-term in a course called Gemstones and Gemology.  I said, \"Are you really going to get college credit for a course on jewelry?\"  She came back with, \"What are you studying?  Aristotle?  What use is that to anybody?\"  So I bet her that I could take the practice exam she was working on and that Aristotle would help me do better than she had after three months of lectures on the subject.\r\n\r\nI took the test.  Not only did I beat my friend's score, I got everything right.  Why?  Aristotle is the foundation of western science.  If you understand Aristotle, you understand how scientific problems are formulated.  In addition, since he started the tradition and his disciples continue it, much of scientific terminology is in Greek or Latin.  I don't have to take a class to tell me what \"anisotropic\" means -- the word itself tells me, and I can guess from it (for example) that anisotropic gems split light in different directions.  (This sort of thing is why it's still worth studying Greek*, even for the pragmatically minded.)  Finally, as the founder of syllogistic logic, Aristotle gives insight into contradictions that allow a test-taker to eliminate incorrect options and to see how questions later in the exam illuminate earlier ones.\r\n\r\nThis is a roundabout way of objecting to the assertion that philosophy \"does not improve the candidate's productivity\".  I think philosophy, like mathematics or other problem-solving disciplines, does increase productivity by giving students tools to analyze problems and to accelerate learning.  And I doubt that most students who study philosophy choose the degree to signal diligence and brains to potential employers -- there are more direct ways of doing this, and most philosophy students don't think about future employment at all**.  Being able to do your coursework in the pub is probably a much more important factor.\r\n\r\n*  I was flipping through a book called something like <em>The Smartest Guy in the World<\/em> in an airport bookstore, about someone who read everything he could to be a success on the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.  I put it down when he confessed that the multiple-choice question he missed was, \"What are red blood cells called?\"  One of the answers, <em>erythrocyte<\/em>, means \"red cell\" in Greek.  Can't be that smart.\r\n\r\n** A friend of mine wrote a comic that I thought was funny at university:  A guy is standing behind a cash register and the customer asks, \"Where's my change?\"  The guy answers, \"<a title=\"True change comes from within\" href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/boblog\/true-change-comes-from-within\/\" target=\"_self\">True change comes from within<\/a>.\"  The caption is, \"Why philosophy majors have trouble finding a job.\"",

Beer is cheaper than at Nana, and it's pretty tame compared to its reputation, but we didn't see any of the \"shows\" on offer, so I can't say for sure it doesn't get worse.  We walked down the nearby street that caters to Japanese tourists, and I marveled anew at the inflated prices Japanese people are willing to pay abroad to establishments that adapt to their culture.  Everyone avoided us until we spoke Japanese, but we found that there is an hourly charge of 600 baht, plus 100 baht per beer, plus 200 for a \"lady drink.\"  That's 900 baht for an hour compared to 240 baht for the same thing (minus karaoke machine, but with no hourly charge) literally two streets down.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/patpong.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1323   aligncenter\" title=\"patpong\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/patpong-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nWe ended up in the quieter side street sharpening up our pool game.  There we saw the small but stout female bartender roust out a drunken German using a truncheon.  Apparently he comes there regularly and she throws him out regularly, and sometimes beats him up too.  It wasn't entertaining — he may have been obnoxious, but I don't think he should be beaten with a club.  (Though maybe he keeps coming back because that's what he's looking for.)  She smacked him twice and I had just decided to say something when he retreated.",

    "post_content": "Several times in the past two days the same woman has pointed to the empty sidewalk in front of me, reached down and pretended to pick up a gold ring that she had been hiding in her hand.  The first time she gave it to me although I tried to decline it.  She showed me that it was too small to fit her (though that would mean it was certainly too small to fit me) and forced it on me.  Then she came back ten seconds later and asked for money.  I assume she probably has better luck with people who actually put the ring on (or ones who don't notice that she is conjuring the ring out of thin air).  Her \"office\" is around the Louvre, but she has so many customers, she didn't recognize me until she tried the trick for the third time.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/louvre.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1508  aligncenter\" title=\"louvre\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/louvre-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nIn Brazil I had a similar kind of trick played on me, also three times:  a guy points at your shoe, you look down to see that it is covered with bird guano.  The guy happens to have a shoeshine kit with him and cleans your dirty shoe for 5 reais, then asks for a tip to \"even them up\".  The first time this happened, I thought it was strange that I hadn't notice any birds or the mess on my shoe.  The second time it happened, I was sure that the shoeshine guy had fouled my shoe, but I didn't see how he did it.  The third time, I figured it out:  the guy points at your shoe, you look down and don't see anything.  You look back up at him and say, \"What?\".  While he's keeping his eyes locked on yours, he squirts the crud on your shoe and says, \"Look!\"  You look again and see the mess and convince yourself you just didn't notice it the first time.  I made the last guy clean my shoes for free — he denied several times that it was a scam, then finally confessed.\r\n\r\nThe virtue of his trick over the gypsy ring trick is that your shoes actually end up dirty and you have to do something about it.  The ring trick relies on a very feeble thread of obligation created when she offers the ring, and reinforced only slightly if you actually take it.\r\n\r\nThe best scam that I actually fell victim to was when someone entered my normally locked apartment complex and started ringing doorbells telling the upstairs people he was a downstairs neighbor and vice versa, asking for change to pay the pizza delivery guy.  I was suspicious, but as I was on slightly bad terms with my upstairs neighbor, having complained about the noise when he and his band held a full-volume rehearsal for seven hours on a Friday night, I thought I should make an investment in bridge-building.  After I closed the door I called the landlord and asked for a description of my upstairs neighbor.  It didn't match the guy at my door, but by that time he was gone.  That delayed suspicion was better than Ollie's, though — he came to my door about an hour later looking for his money and I had to tell him he had been conned.  His response:  \"The dirty dog!\"\r\n\r\nAfter that incident, I went and introduced myself to all my neighbors.  I also made a personal rule to look at all requests for money as simply requests for money — to ignore the story or trappings that surround the request and decide whether to give money for the sake of charity or in expectation of a return or repayment.  I think this has helped me avoid giving money in circumstances that play on the very natural inclination to be obliging, as with the false monk in Thailand.\r\n\r\n\"Don't cross a gypsy, boy\" is what the old bats in grey pea coats around Picadilly Circus curse you with if you don't let them put a flower in your buttonhole.  If you do let them, they hit you up for cash.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/orsay.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1509  aligncenter\" title=\"orsay\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/orsay-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>",

    "post_content": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">On my flight home to Tokyo from my last trip to Bangkok, Thai Airways invited monks to board first before making the usual announcement about \"guests traveling with small children and people needing extra time.\"<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When I got to the counter I asked why and they told me that monks are not allowed to touch women, and letting them board first helps keep them from getting accidentally jostled.  Apparently it works the same on the metro:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/monkseat.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1306  aligncenter\" title=\"monkseat\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/monkseat-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\nI wondered if monks are allowed to touch ladyboys, but it's hard to ask and not have it seem like a prurient rather than a philosophical question.\r\n\r\nWhile walking down Sukhumvit Road, I've been approached on two occasions by a man wearing saffron monk robes.  He was very aggressive in asking for money, and singled me out of a host of Thai people walking down the same street.  I didn't give him any money for several small reasons:  He was wearing street shoes, not sandals; he singled me (the foreigner) out, which I didn't want to encourage; he was out begging in the early evening and I had read that monks were meant to live on alms they collected each day before noon.\r\n\r\nI understand that all Thai men are monks at some stage in their lives, even if it's only for one day.  It seems to me that the point of living from alms is to learn humility and self-denial, and to understand your interdependence with other members of your community.  You can't learn these things by begging from tourists (presumably because they have more money) rather than your co-religionists.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I read this excerpt from the Diamond Sutra quoted in Paul Theroux's <em>Ghost Train To The Eastern Star<\/em> yesterday:\r\n<blockquote>Buddha teaches that the mind of a Bodhisattva should not accept the appearances of things as a basis when exercising charity.<\/blockquote>",

    "post_content": "I've been off work for the past two weeks, but today is officially my last day. Not going into the office was surprisingly easy to get used to, but not getting paid is probably going to take more adjustment.\r\n\r\nI decided to take a sabbatical to do some traveling before moving to Shanghai to study Mandarin. Since I announced my decision, I've received a lot of kind notes and encouragement from friends and even relative strangers. Many of them say that it is a brave thing to do. Is that code for \"foolhardy\"?\r\n<h4>Signals<\/h4>\r\nHowever much I love this company, the signals all point in the same direction:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>I have been here for over seven years (in three different offices, sure, but that's a long time relative both to my working life and to my age).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I have just wrapped up the current project I moved from Tokyo to accomplish.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The person I hired and trained as my successor is more than ready for the role.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I had a number in mind when I started this job, and I hit it last November.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I want to take a year off to travel at some point in my life.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The opportunity cost is relatively low: my salary is only going to get higher (making a year off in the future more expensive), and the credit crunch is likely to affect our bonuses (making this year the best one to miss a bonus, if I have to pick one).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The business team I work with is essentially the same as when I started -- a change will be refreshing.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Moving to a new internal role would mean a 2-3 year commitment in order to make a real difference, which is a long time to wait if I do want to take a sabbatical.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I'm more likely to get my next big increase in responsibility by moving externally than by moving internally.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I've got a big birthday in November, and would rather mark this year than subsequent ones.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>I am ready for a new adventure.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4>Charts<\/h4>\r\nThere is yet another good reason to move. I don't think folks in technology give this much thought, but their trajectory is different from that of the business team (this applies mainly to the \"partnerships\" we develop in finance -- if I were working for a technology firm, the following wouldn't be as relevant). The IT \"earning curve\" starts off much higher than that of the typical business team member, but is flatter, which means that at some point, after more or less time being more valuable (as measured by compensation), technology is left in the dust. Here's the chart:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-277\" title=\"Compensation Comparison\" src=\"http:\/\/www.shanghaibob.com\/tools\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/compcomp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"392\" height=\"320\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis graph is based on real data, but I obscured the actual numbers. The first jump in the business line is moving from graduate to FTE. The jump in both lines between -3 and -2 is promotion to principal\/vice president. The last data point for both series is just a continuation of the previous year's progression to make the trend more visible. The red dot marks now, where the difference in values is currently just 2.3%.\r\n\r\nWhat this chart shows is that I have exactly this year captured the last of the alpha to be gained from opting for a career in technology. In the next year or so my business counterparts will outpace me significantly and continue to accelerate. There are two possible responses if I want to avoid this:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Stay on the same curve but increase my y-coordinate (e.g. by changing firms, which usually entails an increase in responsibility and compensation).<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Look for a new curve (e.g., by moving to a business team or joining a technology company where I can contribute directly to the bottom line).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWhat is consistent in both alternatives is the need for a move.\r\n<h4>Signs<\/h4>\r\nFinally, there's the omen. The day after I handed in my resignation, I talked to a friend of mine on the trading desk in Tokyo. He said, \"You'll never guess what I did. I resigned! And you'll NEVER guess what I'm GOING to do. I'm moving to Shanghai to study Chinese!\"\r\n\r\nMy signals, my charts, and my friends all indicated it was time to take a risk!",
