# Should I call this 'magnitude'?

Planck length: = sqrt((h-bar * G)/c^3) â‰ˆ 10^-35 meters...

"... a studpendously small distance that's about a hundred million trillion times smaller than the diameter of a proton. The corresponding Planck time is the time it would take light to traverse this distance, which is about 10^-43 seconds. Space and time would no longer make sense below these scales. They're the end of the line.
    These numbers put a bound on how fine we could ever slice space or time. To get a feel for the level of precision we're talking about here, consider how many digits we would need to make one of the most extreme comparisons imaginable. Take the largest possible distance, the estimated diameter of the known universe, and divide it by the smallest possible distance, the Planck length. That unfathomably extreme ratio of distances is a number with only sixty digits in it.... That's that most we would ever need to express one distance in terms of another."
