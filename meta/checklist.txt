export TITLE=<title>
export LTITLE=$(echo $TITLE | tr A-Z a-z | tr " " "-").html
echo $TITLE
echo $LTITLE
cp TEMPLATE.html $LTITLE
insert mode C-r =$TITLE to insert title

add title in h1 tags
add Title in top <title> tag
change left arrow nav '<' to be previous entry: use relative file format with .html suffix, e.g., ./switches-on-bits  [use .html because I can then navigate to files in this directory, too!]
