You should do more presentations:

    You'll attract friends
    You'll build a community
    You'll refine your ideas
    Articulating your thoughts will generate new insights
    You'll learn about your audience
    You'll become more confident
    People will encourage you
    You'll increase your luck surface area — interesting things will happen to you
    It will be exciting
    You will (immediately or eventually) have fun
    You will (probably, eventually) get paid more
    It will be OK


If your presentation is soon and you don't have much time to prepare, here are a few things that will help now:

    Practice as much as you can in the time you have left
    Let your enthusiasm for the topic show
    Get to the venue early to get settled
    Remember that it will be OK


The people whose opinions I most want to hear are sometimes the people most reluctant to offer their view. You might think that this is analytically true, since people who are not reluctant to share their opinions don't allow opportunity for suspense to build. But I mean something more — thoughtful, earnest people who hone their technical skills often also have the best opportunity to offer meaningful, original insights, but tend to be less likely to speak up.

There are probably many reasons for this. Most of the analysts I work with are introverts, most are non-native English speakers, most of them spend most of their time improving their technical skills, and often that technical expertise makes them wary of drawing firm conclusions from data with a low signal-to-noise ratio.

This sometimes leads to situations where articulate, ambitious non-technical people end up confidently presenting the work of ...

In order to counteract this tendency...

In my experience, willingness to share an opinion is not highly correlated with the quality of the opinion. The discipline, skill level, thoughtfulness, and insight needed to reason about data 

Even if you subscribe to the school that you should try things, see what happens, then refine your ideas, "seeing what happens" requires insight and judgment; so does deciding what to do next. And even the "try stuff" should not be random.

We started doing presentation practice every two weeks: Once a month we would read a book or watch a video on presentation skills, marketing, stand-up comedy, or storytelling in advance, then meet to analyze the ideas and share our reactions.

Two weeks later we would meet again to practice the skills we had learned. Each person would identify three things they wanted to keep in mind during their presentation, then present for around five minutes. Then we would go around the table and offer feedback on how to improve.

Within three months there was already a huge improvement. Just six sessions of thinking about presentation skills and three sessions of practicing made a remarkable difference. I mean this literally in that other coworkers in other regions sent me notes praising their skills. Better presentations led to more opportunities to present, and opportunities for closer collaboration. It also hugely improved team members' confidence in the value of their insights and in their willingness to be the center of attention.

We invited other teams to attend these sessions, and they always found them memorable. We reviewed many techniques, and everyone found something that resonated with their approach. Improved relationships, too.

I've collected everything we learned from books on presentation skills, marketing, stand-up comedy, memory, and storytelling and from my own experience explaining complex ideas ... statistical methodology to audiences that range from systematic quants at hedge funds and asset managers to non-technical account managers fielding questions from ...

The advice ranges, before during after, logistical, content, skill level...so I've tried to organize the suggestions so that you can indicate your situation and hopefully get a subset of advice 

The title of this post is intentionally somewhat of a tease; it embodies some of the advice that follows, including:

    Choose a good title
    Tease your audience to engage their interest
    Create mystery that you resolve after you deliver your message
    Tell a story to engage your audience's emotions and help them solidify memories

So here's the simple story:

By strange circumstance, I attended the Creative Mornings bi-annual convention as a volunteer even though I have never been to a Creative Mornings meeting. Every two years the leaders of Creative Mornings organizations around the world convene for four days to celebrate, plan, learn from each other, and have fun. The year I attended, it was hosted at a summer camp in upstate New York, and Seth Godin gave the keynote speech.

So Seth and I did share a stage, but the arrangement was me hauling heavy things to clear the stage, bucking hay bales to provide an impromptu lectern in keeping with the rustic theme, then sweeping up stray hay before his talk began.

Here's the video


Here's a photo of the Creative Mornings crew with me in it somewhere if you want to do Where's Waldo/Where's Wally/Where's Roberto.


Here's a short video of the entertaining dinner bell on the last night.


All the presentation advice.
