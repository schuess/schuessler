I Memorize Things

# Background

My family placed unusual demands on memory. We moved over 16 times before I started my senior year of high school, so I had to learn 16 addresses, phone numbers, groups of kids' names, and ways home. A routine part of outings was having my dad pull over and ask me how we had got there. I wasn't allowed to say 'left', or 'right', but had to describe every turn using compass bearings.

My uncle was a California highway patrolman and later a marshal. He made me memorize the alphabet backwards. He was frustrated that even sober people couldn't do it, and he wanted me to be prepared for when I started to drive and might be pulled over by one of his colleagues. He himself used to casually memorize the license plate of every car he parked near, and as a kid I was terrified on behalf of the hypothetical bad drivers who might ding his truck and drive off thinking he wouldn't find them and exact revenge.

We used to visit the jail occasionally when I was a kid back in California for the summers. As a result I conceived the (I now recognize) bizarre idea that everyone eventually goes to prison. I began to notice stories of political prisoners sustaining themselves in isolation with foreign languages and poems they had memorized, and this increased my desire to furnish my brain. (The Count of Monte Cristo really affected me.)

She denies this now, but my mother paid me $22 in today's dollars to memorize the times tables through 12 x 12 overnight when I told her our math teacher said parents should help us learn them.

Finally, when I was 11 I found we had a book on memory techniques written by a magician. By that point, memorizing things seemed like a necessary skill, so I memorized the techniques and started to use them at school.


# Applications

OK, so with that background, here are a few examples of things I memorized. I want to show what I thought of as a normal thing to do.

For every essay exam in college I would guess ten questions I thought might appear, find commonalities between five pairs of questions so I could reduce them to themes, then write five essays (with citations) on those five themes, then memorize those essays. I never had to answer an essay question I hadn't already written an essay for. When I told my mom the strategy I had come up with to guarantee A's, she said she had done exactly the same thing (though for fewer questions).

Because I misunderstood a line on our syllabus, I memorized the title, recording date, and band composition for over 150 classic jazz recordings. When my roommate took music theory from the same professor a year later, the professor said he couldn't listen to any complaints about how hard it is to remember chord resolutions and gave them my example as explanation.

As a grad school TA I would memorize students's names as they introduced themselves on the first day, then repeat them back immediately and again at the end of class.

I memorized the entire argument of Plato's Republic using a memory palace and memorized Odysseus and Achilles's exchange in the underworld in ancient Greek.

When I learned in my first German class that prepositions take different cases, I extracted every preposition from the text and memorized their cases over a weekend. (A friend later taught me a couple of songs that he learned at the Goethe Institut that accomplished the same thing with way less effort.) With the help of a wonderfully patient professor, I memorized dozens of poems by Goethe, Rilke, and Heine so I had an internalized pronunciation reference.


# You are a Robot, You Lack Creativity

Memorizing things seems practical to me. In the same way that you might pack a lunch when you know you're going to need a lunch, you should just pack a few things in your head whenever you think you might need them later.

After university, though, I've regularly run into people who are philosophically opposed to memorization. These are usually engineers or scientists that I respect, so it often made me feel bad.

I would argue that people who are very experienced with concepts eventually memorize them and then work with them at a higher level of fluency, and that you can jump-start this fluency by just memorizing up front. The contrary position was often that any memorization is 'rote memorization', which is by its nature evil, anti-creative, and evidence of a lack of true understanding -- people should derive concepts from first principles as they need them. Steve Yegge says that "Having a good memory is a serious impediment to understanding. It lets you cheat your way through life." http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html.  

These criticisms used to sting, but in recent years, conversations of this sort have been followed by the critics' forwarding a link to Michael Nielsen's article on memorization with Anki. I am very grateful that Michael wrote this, as it rebuts a lot of the arguments against memorization and makes a very persuasive case for.

### Techniques

Like Michael, I use Anki and SRS (or flashcards generally) to memorize things, but I also use many of the techniques that he eschews.

Here is a list of the techniques I find useful, a brief description of how they work and what they are good for, and a link to an example. Because these techniques are readily accessible, and because literally *one person* of the dozens that have asked me to explain these techniques has taken the time to learn and use them, I won't spend a lot of time elaborating them. Instead, I will spend some time below on the depth of learning that is possible with these techniques.


TODO: Add link from other posts to this one
I use several of the most common techniques regularly. Rather than 
Technique, How I use it, Example, Effort to learn
Mnemonic link; Assign nouns to the items I want to memorize, then link them together with verbs; celestial crown; low
Major system, Use sounds to represent string so of digits, then tie them together with mnemonic link, wikipedia; high
Peg system, Major system for fixed numbers provide a set of quick 'hooks' for memorizing lists, wikipedia; high (but ~zero if you already know the Major Sytem)
Memory palace, Remember items by mentally placing them in a well-known space, wikipedia; medium
Anki, spaced repetition, flashcards; Review regularly, especially just as you're about to forget; wikipedia; low
drawing/painting, schematics; high/idiosyncratic


### How I use them
I use all of these techniques (including Anki and spaced repetition as noted above), but Mnemonic Link and the Major System are the most routinely useful. I've included links and examples above so you can learn how to use them. Rather than review the techniques proper, I want to explain How I apply them, and some non-obvious ways they are useful. I think this may motivate more people to learn these skills to enhance their minds.

### Staple Gun
If I have to do something more than twice, I try to automate it the third time. The Staple Gun approach to memorization is similar -- if I have to look something up more than twice, I take a few minutes to pin it in memory, then move on.

Here's a trivial example, worthy of the staple gun: In college, my edition of Meditations on First Philosophy had a portrait of the author that made him look like musketeer. Every time I saw it, I wondered why, but it was never important enough to pursue (and hard to google: Why does Descartes dress like a musketeer?). Finally, I looked up and memorized a few dates:

René Descartes dates: 1596-1650
Cyrano de Bergerac set: 1640
The Three Musketeers set: 1625-1628

Apparently lots of people dressed like musketeers when Descartes was alive.

This is exactly the kind of rote memorization that people object to, but once you know the Major System, it takes less time to memorize something than to look it up again. Of course that's not a good reason to memorize things! I could look these dates up each time my curiosity is aroused, but, in the same way that I desire to automate small annoyances out of existence, I also like to permanently satisfy these recurring curiosities. There is a side benefit that the more dates you have welded into your brain (especially about things you are actually curious about), the easier it is to understand the context for other new things that you're interested in.

Even if you don't care about historical dates, there may be things that you've looked up multiple times each time you need them. With the Staple Gun approach, you could remember it permanently in the time it takes to look it up twice.




Staple Gun -- if you have to look up something routinely, just nail it down.

Quickly memorize something when away from notes; nail down something that I look up repeatedly (how to perform some task, for example)
peg system, mnemonic link
Fast, superficial
Quickly memorize something that I use frequently
when was descartes born/died musketeer/cyrano/three musketeers
Memorize something on the fly when I am away from my desk/notes.


### Deep Foundation
Learning something completely new; memorization provides pilings for a deep foundation -- these are both fixed points to build on and 'landmarks' for orienting yourself in future studies
just memorize some random facts and start building
mnemonic link, major system, flashcards
my own personal metaphor is of a marsh. The landscape is undifferentiated, and you don't have any firm ground, but if you hammer pilings down in the deep foundation so you have both landmarks and something to build on. You can bootstrap/chunk up more quickly if you just nail a few things down.

### Nerve splicing
connect topics (especially dry ones) to things I already know and have an interest in
find interest in a new topic
Example anthropomobi

### Miscellaneous
can do physical stuff: scavenger hunt
the other techqniques let you figure out when you're paying enough attention -- after a while, you realize how much attention you have to pay to memorize 30 names and you don't need techniques.
make little circles for people around you -- people tend to sit in the same place
make a seating grid
draw things


# Why memorize
The examples above give a few reasons to memorize things -- to speed up learning, remove an annoyance, fill in when your phone or a pen is not available.

I think the best reason to memorize, though, is that it allows you to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunk</a> things -- a lot of progress in thinking is through abstraction, and a lot of that occurs incrementally, so 

The 'derive from first principles' people are making a similar argument -- in fact, it's a good approach to memoriation, as you deepen the groove. But I think the early floundering part is a waste of time -- just nail things down completely and then start working on refinement.

There is also an aesthetic connection. As I mentioned in the 'nerve splicing' case, connecting something with other interests makes it come alive, and I read enough stories of philosophers and sophists in my childhood that learning techniques that they actually used before paper was common and cheap appeals to me.


The most important reason is chunking, but an important second in another domain is being able to 'range' your ability. My feeling when I memorize something is not that I am using a 'trick' and somehow doing less work than another person who memorize through frequent exposure. It is more that I am using leverage or perhaps better pressure to increase throughput. I'm doing the same amount of work, just more effectively and so more intensely. One side effect is that I have a sense of how much effort is required to do the work.

One of the poems I memorized is Der Panther. It's depressing, but contains a number of evocative images, and 'sounds' like the thing it is describing. One line is: 'nur manchmal schiebt der forhang der Pupille/sich lautlos auf, dan geht ein Bild hinein'. In the poem the image dies, but this poem has colored my view of memorization. I think of it as lifting a stone door guarding a cave to let in light. It takes intense effort and you can't hold it open very long, but when you do it, you can 'see' something intensely and unforgettably.

I don't use any kind of techniques for meeeting pepole now, instead, I try to lift the cave door. I try to make this effort now in learning names. I try to really pay attention when meeting someone now and try to sear it in my brain the first time. Of course it's not perfect, so I will repeat the name every time I see the person to make sure I've got it. But the practice makes me stronger at door lifts, and I enjoy the effort. It's the ultimate mindfulness practice.

bootstrap faster

It covers a lot of great points that I don't need to cover, including how he uses flashcards and spaced repetition through Anki, which I also love. Michael mentions some other techniques 

they seem most useful for memorizing trivia – sequences of playing cards, strings of digits, and so on. They seem less well developed for more abstract concepts, and such abstractions are often where the deepest understanding lies. In that sense, they may even distract from understanding. That said, it's possible I simply need to figure out better ways of using these ideas, much as I needed to figure out Anki. In particular, it may be worth further investigating some of the techniques used by practitioners to form rich associations. As Foer says, quoting a memory expert, there is great value in learning to “think in more memorable ways”.

By contrast, Plato tried to argue that understanding was really just remembering (anamnesis). The main argument is the geometric proof that he leads the servant to in the Meno using the maieutic method, but there is an interesting related passage in the Phaedrus 
Interestingly, Plato has Socrates make the opposite argument, that with the gift of writing lots of people can appear wise without really being so

### Is it worth it
X complained that our memories would atrophy if started relying on writing and now we complain that our creativity and understanding will atrophy if we rely on memory.

These ancient techniques seem well suited to the modern age, with its focus on efficiency and productivity, mindfulness, overt displays of prowess


I spent a year or so in France, and instead of coming back for the summer, I moved to Germany to see if I could get a job and improve my German. I got a job as an assistant blacksmith mainly because I am strong and the job was mostly holding onto things while someone hammered them, and carrying huge, heavy things made of iron up lots of stairs.

My first day on the job, as we were finishing up, the foreman asked if I would drive one of the pickups back since the morning driver had already left for the day. I said sure. At the first light, the lead truck sped through the interesection as the light turned red, forgetting that I was following him back to the warehouse. Soon he was out of sight. As I waited for the light to turn green, I contemplated my position: a foreigner, with vocabulary almost exclusively limited to lyric and romantic poetry, in Germany on a tourist visa, with no driver's license, credit card, or phone, driving a truck he couldn't prove a connection to, lost in a town he'd never been to before. But almost immediately my dad's 'training' paid off. Our path out to the work site unrolled itself in my head, I could sort of see its relation to the river, and I was able to make it back to the warehouse about ten minutes after the lead truck, when everyone was yelling about the situation, but hadn't started panicking yet.
