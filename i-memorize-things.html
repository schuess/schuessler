I Memorize Things

# Background

My family placed unusual demands on memory. We moved over 16 times before I started my senior year of high school, so I had to learn 16 addresses, phone numbers, groups of kids' names, and ways home. A routine part of outings was having my dad pull over and ask me how we had got there. I wasn't allowed to say 'left', or 'right', but had to describe every turn using compass bearings.

My uncle was a California highway patrolman and later a marshal. He made me memorize the alphabet backwards. He was frustrated that even sober people couldn't do it, and he wanted me to be prepared for when I started to drive and might be pulled over by one of his colleagues. He himself used to casually memorize the license plate of every car he parked near, and as a kid I was terrified on behalf of the hypothetical bad drivers who might ding his truck and drive off thinking he wouldn't find them and exact revenge.

As a pre-teen I once helped my uncles capture an escaped prisoner, and we used to visit the jail occasionally when I was a kid back in California for the summers. As a result I conceived the (I now recognize) bizarre idea that everyone eventually goes to prison. I began to notice stories of political prisoners sustaining themselves in isolation with foreign languages and poems they had memorized, and this increased my desire to furnish my brain. (The Count of Monte Cristo really affected me.)

She denies this now, but my mother paid me $22 in today's dollars to memorize the times tables through 12 x 12 overnight when I told her our math teacher said parents should help us learn them.

When I was 11 I found we had a book on memory techniques written by a magician. I memorized the techniques and started to use them at school.


# Exploits

OK, so with that background, here are a few examples of things that I memorized. These are relatively trivial examples; I'm recording them to show what I thought of as a normal thing to do.

For every essay exam in college I would guess ten questions I thought might appear, find commonalities between five pairs of questions so I could reduce them to themes, then write five essays (with citations) on those five themes, then memorize those essays. I never saw a question I hadn't already written an essay for. When I told my mom the strategy I had come up with to guarantee A's, she said she had done exactly the same thing (though for fewer questions).

Because I misunderstood a line on our syllabus, I memorized the title, recording date, and band composition for over 150 classic jazz recordings. When my roommate took music theory from the same professor a year later, the professor said he couldn't listen to any complaints about how hard it is to remember chord resolutions and gave them my example as explanation.

As a grad school TA I would memorize students's names as they introduced themselves on the first day, then repeat them back immediately and again at the end of class.

I memorized the entire argument of Hobbes' Leviathan using a memory palace and memorized Odysseus and Achilles's exchange in the underworld in ancient Greek.

When I learned in my first German class that prepositions take different cases, I extracted every preposition from the text and memorized their cases over a weekend. (A friend later taught me a couple of songs that he learned at the Goethe Institute that accomplished the same thing with way less effort.) With the help of a wonderfully patient professor, I memorized dozens of poems by Goethe, Rilke, Heine, and Gottfried Benn so I had an internalized pronunciation reference.


# You are a Robot, You Lack Creativity

Memorizing things seems very practical to me. In the same way that you might pack a lunch when you know you're going to need a lunch, you should just pack a few things in your head whenever you know you're going to need them later.

After university, though, I've regularly run into people who are horrified that I memorize things. These are usually engineers or scientists that I respect, so it often made me feel bad.

I would argue that people who are very experienced with concepts eventually memorize them and then work with them at a higher level of fluency, and that you can jump-start this fluency by just memorizing up front. The counterargument was often that any memorization is 'rote memorization', which is by its nature evil and anti-creative, and that people should derive any concepts from first princples as they need them. Steve Yegge says that "Having a good memory is a serious impediment to understanding. It lets you cheat your way through life." http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html.  

These criticisms used to sting, but in recent years, they have almost always been followed by a link to Michael Nielsen's article on memorization using Anki. I am very grateful that he wrote this, as it rebuts a lot of the arguments against and makes a very persuasive case for memorization.


# Trivial Techniques

I won't talk about the value of flashcards or SRS <link> since Michael does that well. I want to talk about some of techniques he doesn't use, and one that I think is peculiar to me. TODO: get link, check terminology.

Below I give an example of every technique I use reguarly. Be warned that literally dozens of people have asked me to explain one or more of these techniques and exactly one ever put in the effort to learn and use them. (He used them to pass his EMT exam!) Don't feel bad if it's not worth the effort to learn these techniques. If I had had wikipedia on my phone growing up, maybe I never would have bothered either.

my own personal metaphor is of a marsh. The landscape is undifferentiated, and you don't have any firm ground, but if you hammer pilings down in the deep foundation so you have both landmarks and something to build on. You can bootstrap/chunk up more quickly if you just nail a few things down.

It covers a lot of great points that I don't need to cover, including how he uses flashcards and spaced repetition through Anki, which I also love. Michael mentions some other techniques 

they seem most useful for memorizing trivia – sequences of playing cards, strings of digits, and so on. They seem less well developed for more abstract concepts, and such abstractions are often where the deepest understanding lies. In that sense, they may even distract from understanding. That said, it's possible I simply need to figure out better ways of using these ideas, much as I needed to figure out Anki. In particular, it may be worth further investigating some of the techniques used by practitioners to form rich associations. As Foer says, quoting a memory expert, there is great value in learning to “think in more memorable ways”.

By contrast, Plato tried to argue that understanding was really just remembering (anamnesis). The main argument is the geometric proof that he leads the servant to in the Meno using the maieutic method, but there is an interesting related passage in the Phaedrus 
Interestingly, Plato has Socrates make the opposite argument, that with the gift of writing lots of people can appear wise without really being so
