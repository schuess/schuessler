<h1>I Memorize Things</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

My family placed unusual demands on memory. We moved 16 times before I started my senior year of high school, so I had to learn 16 addresses, phone numbers, groups of kids' names, and ways home. A routine part of outings was having my dad pull over and ask me how we had got there. I wasn't allowed to say 'left', or 'right', but had to describe every turn using compass bearings.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
My uncle was a California highway patrolman and later a marshal. He made me memorize the alphabet backwards. He was annoyed that even sober people couldn't do it, so thought I should make it second nature before I got my driver's license. He himself used to casually memorize the license plate of every car he parked near (and as a kid I was terrified on behalf of the hypothetical bad drivers who might ding his truck and drive off thinking he couldn't find them).
</p><p>
We used to visit the jail regularly when I was a kid back in California for the summers. As a result I conceived the (I now recognize) bizarre idea that everyone eventually goes to prison. After that, I began to notice stories of political prisoners sustaining themselves in isolation with foreign languages and poems they had memorized, and this increased my desire to furnish my brain. (The <em>Count of Monte Cristo</em> especially affected me.)
</p><p>
She denies this now, but my mother paid me $22 in today's dollars to memorize the times tables through 12x12 overnight when I told her our math teacher said parents should help us learn them.
</p><p>
Finally, when I was 11 I found we had a book on memory techniques written by a magician. By that point, memorizing things seemed like a necessary skill, so I learned all the techniques and started to use them at school.
</p>


<h2>Applications</h2>

OK, so with that background, here are a few examples of things I memorized. I want to show what I thought of as a normal thing to do.
<p>
For every essay exam in college I would guess a handful of questions I thought might appear, find commonalities between pairs of questions so I could reduce them to themes, then write 3-5 essays (with citations) on those themes, then memorize the essays. I never had to answer an essay question I hadn't already written an essay for. When I told my mom the strategy I had come up with to guarantee A's, she said she had done exactly the same thing.
</p><p>
Because I misunderstood a line on our syllabus, I memorized the title, recording date, and band composition for over 150 classic jazz recordings. When my roommate took music theory from the same professor a year later, the professor said he couldn't listen to any complaints about how hard it is to remember chord resolutions and gave them my example as explanation.
</p><p>
As a grad school TA I would memorize students's names as they introduced themselves on the first day, then repeat them back immediately and again at the end of class.
</p><p>
I memorized the entire argument of Plato's Republic using a memory palace and memorized Odysseus and Achilles's exchange in the underworld in ancient Greek.
</p><p>
When I learned in my first German class that prepositions take different cases, I extracted every preposition from the text and memorized their cases over a weekend. (A friend later taught me a couple of songs that he learned at the Goethe Institut that accomplished the same thing with way less effort.) With the help of a wonderfully patient professor, I memorized dozens of poems by Goethe, Rilke, and Heine so I had an internalized pronunciation reference.


<h2>You are a Robot, You Lack Creativity</h2>

Growing up, memorizing things seemed practical and ordinary. In the same way that you might pack a lunch when you know you're going to need a lunch, you can just pack a few things into your head whenever you think you might need them later.
<p>
After university, though, I've regularly run into people who are philosophically opposed to memorization. These are usually engineers or scientists that I respect, so it often made me feel bad.
</p><p>
I argued that people who are very experienced with concepts eventually memorize them and then work with them at a higher level of fluency, and that you can jump-start this fluency by memorizing up front. The contrary position was often that any memorization is 'rote memorization', which is by its nature evil, anti-creative, and evidence of a lack of true understanding. Instead of memorizing, the counterargument continued, people should derive concepts from first principles as they need them. Steve Yegge <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html">says</a> "Having a good memory is a serious impediment to understanding. It lets you cheat your way through life." 
</p><p>
These criticisms used to sting, but in recent years, conversations of this sort have been followed by the critics' forwarding a link to Michael Nielsen's <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">article</a> on memorization with Anki. I am grateful that Michael wrote this, as it rebuts a lot of the arguments against memorization and makes a persuasive case for (it's also partly an <em>argumentum ad verecundiam</em>, which people find persuasive: "Well this smart guy says it's OK, so...".


<h2>Techniques</h2>

Like Michael, I use Anki and SRS (and flashcards generally) to memorize things, but I also use many of the techniques that he eschews. I want to explain how I use them and why I find them a valuable complement to SRS.
<p>
Here is a list of the techniques I find useful, a brief description of how they work and what they are good for, and a link to an example. Because these techniques are readily accessible, and because literally *one person* of the dozens that have asked me to explain these techniques has taken the time to learn and use them, I won't spend a lot of time elaborating them. Instead, I will spend some time below on the depth of learning that is possible with these techniques.
TODO: Add link from other memory posts to this one
</p><p>
I use several of the most common techniques regularly. Rather than 
Technique, How I use it, Example, Effort to learn, Depends on
Mnemonic link; Assign nouns to the items I want to memorize, then link them together with verbs; celestial crown; low
Major system, Use sounds to represent string so of digits, then tie them together with mnemonic link, wikipedia; high; makes use of mnemonic link
Peg system, Major system for fixed numbers provide a set of quick 'hooks' for memorizing lists, wikipedia; high (but ~zero if you already know the Major Sytem)
Memory palace, Remember items by mentally placing them in a well-known space, wikipedia; medium
Anki, spaced repetition, flashcards; Review regularly, especially just as you're about to forget; wikipedia; low
drawing/painting, schematics; high/idiosyncratic
</p><p>
</p><p>
TODO: Make a cheat sheet
</p>

<h2>Memory Applications</h2>

I use all of these techniques (including Anki and spaced repetition as noted above), but I find Mnemonic Link and the Major System the most routinely useful. I've included links and examples above so you can learn how to use them. Rather than review the techniques proper, I want to explain How I apply them, and some non-obvious ways they are useful. I think this may motivate more people to learn these skills to enhance their minds.
</p>

<h3>Staple Gun</h3>

I'm afraid the first example of how I use these techniques vindicates the critics -- I really do use them for memorizing arbitrary trivia! But I'll explain why I think this is a useful skill to have. If you are the kind of person who will write a script to automate a recurring task, the Staple Gun approach to memorization is the equivalent. Of course you can look up a fact or the steps of a process whenever you need to, but with training, you can pin things in memory in less time than it takes to look them up twice.
<p>
Here's an example: in college, my edition of <em>Meditations on First Philosophy</em> had a portrait of the author on the cover that made him look like a musketeer. Every time I saw it, I wondered why, but it was never important enough to pursue (and hard to google: "Why does Descartes dress like a musketeer?"). Finally, I looked up and memorized a few dates:
</p><p>
Ren√© Descartes: 1596-1650
Cyrano de Bergerac set in: 1640
The Three Musketeers set in: 1625-1628
</p><p>
Apparently lots of people dressed like musketeers when Descartes was alive.
</p><p>
This is exactly the kind of rote memorization that people object to, but once you know the Major System, it takes less time to memorize something than to look it up again. Of course that's not a good reason to memorize things! I could look these dates up each time I identify a new potential overlap, but it's convenient to have them available on demand.
</p><p>
There is a side benefit that the more dates you have welded into your brain (especially about things you are actually curious about), the easier it is to place new things in historical context. If I read that Newton's insights into calculus occurred during the plague years, I can put that in the context of Descartes's life and consider how long it might take for his analytic geometry to influence other thinkers.
</p><p>
Most useful techniques: Major System, Mnemonic Link
</p>

<h3>Deep Foundation</h3>

One of the 16 moves our family made was to Florida, where we lived first on the Kissimmee River in the swampy interior, then later on a sailboat on Anna Maria Island. Every morning I would jump overboard and swim under the barnacle-covered pilings sunk deep into the basin that held up the dock connecting us to the island.
<p>
A new domain can sometimes seem like a big, undifferentiated expanse of water or swamp. Memorizing does two things: it lets me drop pilings down into a firm foundation so I have something to build on; it also creates landmarks that help me orient myself as I learn.
</p><p>
As Michael notes, you usually want to work with the important abstractions. But how do you get there? I choose a few things (sometimes even arbitrarily) and memorize them; those provide a foundation on which to build a more elaborate structure. For example, when I read for the third or fourth time <em>The Republic</em> in grad school, I memorized the order in which the characters appeared. This gave me a framework to hang their arguments from. When my colleagues and I read Jurafsky and Martin's Natural Language Processing text, I memorized the attributes of the common activation functions as a first step toward creating a more abstract understanding of their use by holding their commonalities in my head.
</p><p>
This Deep Foundation approach differs from the previous approach in that you are learning or creating <em>context</em>, not just nailing down arbitrary facts. A common metaphor for learning is building an 'edifice of knowledge' -- memorizing can let you build the foundation quickly and move on to something you can inhabit or use.
</p><p>
Most useful technique: Memory Palace
</p>


<h2># Nerve Splicing</h2>

The last major approach I use is the most involved. Often the subject is more constrained than a whole discipline, but maybe fairly abstract (and perhaps also fairly dry). I use it often with programming techniques or mathematical concepts.
</p><p>
Phaedrus 265d-266a
The Phaedrus memory, expert, Catch-22
</p><p>
If you ware working with an expert, you can see where the joints are
Plato objects that you can't engage with a text, you need an expert.
Lets you 'carve nature at its joints' to use a metaphor from the Phaedrus.
</p><p>
In learning it is easy to think you understand something when it is explained. It's much harder to use it or apply it. This is especially true in math or philosophy. You need facility with the concept -- practice using it, not just exposure to it.
</p><p>
I think of this as 'nerve splicing', because you are grafting a new concept onto existing ones and making them vibrate with interests you already have. 
</p><p>
This is especially effective if the topic is somewhat dry. If you can connect it to things you already know, or especially to existing interests, you can animate a topic for yourself then let your natural curiosity deepen your relationship to it using impulses you already have.
</p><p>
Anthropomobi/XOR swap example/link. Very idiosyncractic; as above, attention/curiosity awakens affection; impulse of curiosity can continue down the new path that you have spliced on.
</p><p>
Most useful technique: Drawing! (see Miscellaneous techniques below)
</p><p>
</p><p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
Many of the techniques above trick your visual or spatial apparatus into remembering things for you. Here are some non-mnemonic practices to help you "think in more memorable ways":
</p><p>
1. Draw/Sketch
It is hard to forget the details of something you have taken the time to draw. In addition (and less obviously), it's hard not to <em>like</em> something more if you pay enough attention to it to draw it. I started drawing pigeons after I got a book on nature journaling, and I really appreciate them now.
</p><p>
You don't have to limit your drawing to things in the world -- you can draw concepts. Laying out relationships (as with mind maps) is very helpful in solidifying ideas in memory.
</p><p>
It may be obvious that drawing helps with understanding and memory, but many people still don't like to do it because they are not 'good' at it. I think it's worth noting that that doesn't matter. The best part about drawing is what happens internally -- you increase your understanding of what you're drawing, your ability to see, and your skill. All of this happens whether someone thinks your drawing is pretty or accurate or not. Plus, you don't need to show anyone your drawings to get the full benefit of them.
</p><p>
One more potential impediment is the impulse to become an art supply collector rather than drawing. You may be more likely to draw if you have tools that you really appreciate, but you can get all the benefit of drawing by starting with a pen or pencil and a sheet of printer paper.
</p><p>
<ol>
<li>
Write
Writing a story about something will help you remember it, especially if you notice and record a wide range of details: emotions, smells, ...
</p><p>
</li><li>
Narrate
If drawing or writing are intimidating, narrate. Say out loud how tall someone is, what color shirt they are wearing, what color eyes they have. There's both a creative element and an observing element. The creative part is "What would be itnteresting to record?" It requires certain kind of attention. And then actually recording it requires another kind of attention. Will you record colors, counts of people, actions, eye color, motivations, back story?
</p><p>
</li><li>
Prime the Pump
The Frequency Illusion or Baader-Meinhof Effect are names for a common phenomenon where something is brought to your attention and then you start noticing it everywhere. I had an uncle who used to say I should try to sell anything at all to somebody in order to wake up my mind to entrepreneurial opportunities that were otherwise invisible.
</p><p>
</li><li>
Make maps
If I sign up for a class, I will make a map of circles in relation to my desk and fill in the names as I learn them. People tend to sit in the same place, so it's easy to accumulate names.
The Memory Palace origin story centers on Simonides of Keos and his narrow escape from a collapsing banquet hall. Supposedly he developed the technique after he realize that he could remember everyone based on their place at the table. Ironically, most people would be happy with just being able to remember people's names.
</p><p>
I also create a seating chart when new employees start, so they can look up people's names when they forget without having to be embarrassed about not knowing.
</li><li>
Cast spells
You can make solidify something in your mind by performing some physical activity or ritual that locks it in place. If you have ever attended a graduation ceremony, you probably appreciate how the unusual robes, the formulaic speeches, and the presence of people you care about create a memorable atmosphere. You can create your own ceremonies to pin something in memory.
</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
<h2> Why Memorize</h2>
</p><p>
As noted above, the most practical reason to memorize is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunking</a>. Memorizing things lets you reach a higher level of abstraction faster, so you get more value out of study sessions.
</p><p>
It's more efficient. Memorization techniques don't necessarily make it *easier* to learn things, but they really do make learning more effective. Learning something permanently right now often takes the same amout of mental effort as reviewing it multiple times over a couple of weeks, but the effort is compressed into a shorter time, and the results are more permanent.
</p><p>
There is also a residual effect, just as with exercise. If you work out, your metabolism increases a little bit even when you're resting. It's the same with memory -- if you practice paying enough attention, you start noticing and remembering things even without special effort.
</p><p>
This leads to another advantage -- with practice, you develop a clear sense of what it feels like to pay enough attention to something to memorize it. This gives you an internal gauge of whether you are paying enough attention, whether you are using memory techniques or not.
</p><p>
</p><p>
Two more uncommon benefits: 
</p><p>
In situations like parties or conferences where attendees are meeting lots of new people, you may hear people say, "I'll never remember all these names." Once you become confident that you *can* remember an arbitrary number of names, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. In addition, it can become something like a game -- I used to be too shy to talk to people at parties; now, I try to talk to everyone at least to say hi in order to "collect" all the names. (This is never a goal of mine, but if you can remember everyone's name, they will all tend to remember yours too.)<sup>2</sup>
</p><p>
Finally, I think the biggest benefit is the one I learned in prison:<sup>3</sup> memorizing lets you assimilate things you admire and make them a permanent part of you; if you do it, you will find that they suggest themselves to you in meaningful situations throughout your life, something that doesn't happen if you just look things up when you have an instrumental need for them.

Funes the memorious -- the opposite!
</p><p>
[Funes] remembered the shapes of the clouds in the south at dawn on the 30th of April of 1882, and he could compare them in his recollection with the marbled grain in the design of a leather-bound book which he had seen only once, and with the lines in the spray which an oar raised in the Rio Negro on the eve of the battle of the Quebracho. These recollections were not simple; each visual image was linked to muscular sensations, thermal sensations, etc. He could reconstruct all his dreams, all his fancies. Two or three times he had reconstructed an entire day.

By contrast, Plato tried to argue that understanding was really just remembering (anamnesis). The main argument is the geometric proof that he leads the servant to in the Meno using the maieutic method, but there is an interesting related passage in the Phaedrus 
Interestingly, Plato has Socrates make the opposite argument, that with the gift of writing lots of people can appear wise without really being so

1. This really helped me once. My first day on the job as a blacksmith's apprentice in W√ºrzburg, Germany, the foreman asked if I could drive one of the pickups back to the warehouse. At the first intersection, he forgot I was following him and sped through a red light. I was a foreigner with no cell phone, no driver's license, no work permit, a truck I couldn't account for, and a limited vocabulary, but before I could worry about it too much, I realized I actually knew the way back. Thanks, Dad!<sup>[return]</sup>

2. I signed up for a group trip to Ecuador a couple of years ago, and on the first night we were all there together, 30+ introduced themselves. After these introductions, the host said he would buy a beer for anyone who could repeat all the names. I said I could do it. He then asked everyone to <em>rearrange</em> themselves, but I was still able to do it. I won the beer, plus everyone in the room had a default conversation topic ("How did you do that?") as we all made friends.<sup>[return]</sup>
