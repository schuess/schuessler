I Memorize Things

# Background

My family placed unusual demands on memory. We moved over 16 times before I started my senior year of high school, so I had to learn 16 addresses, phone numbers, groups of kids' names, and ways home. A routine part of outings was having my dad pull over and ask me how we had got there. I wasn't allowed to say 'left', or 'right', but had to describe every turn using compass bearings.

My uncle was a California highway patrolman and later a marshal. He made me memorize the alphabet backwards. He was frustrated that even sober people couldn't do it, and he wanted me to be prepared for when I started to drive and might be pulled over by one of his colleagues. He himself used to casually memorize the license plate of every car he parked near, and as a kid I was terrified on behalf of the hypothetical bad drivers who might ding his truck and drive off thinking he wouldn't find them and exact revenge.

As a pre-teen I once helped my uncles capture an escaped prisoner, and we used to visit the jail occasionally when I was a kid back in California for the summers. As a result I conceived the (I now recognize) bizarre idea that everyone eventually goes to prison. I began to notice stories of political prisoners sustaining themselves in isolation with foreign languages and poems they had memorized, and this increased my desire to furnish my brain. (The Count of Monte Cristo really affected me.)

She denies this now, but my mother paid me $22 in today's dollars to memorize the times tables through 12 x 12 overnight when I told her our math teacher said parents should help us learn them.

When I was 11 I found we had a book on memory techniques written by a magician. I memorized the techniques and started to use them at school.


# Exploits

OK, so with that background, here are a few examples of things that I memorized. These are relatively trivial examples; I'm recording them to show what I thought of as a normal thing to do.

For every essay exam in college I would guess ten questions I thought might appear, find commonalities between five pairs of questions so I could reduce them to themes, then write five essays (with citations) on those five themes, then memorize those essays. I never had to answer an essay question I hadn't already written an essay for. When I told my mom the strategy I had come up with to guarantee A's, she said she had done exactly the same thing (though for fewer questions).

Because I misunderstood a line on our syllabus, I memorized the title, recording date, and band composition for over 150 classic jazz recordings. When my roommate took music theory from the same professor a year later, the professor said he couldn't listen to any complaints about how hard it is to remember chord resolutions and gave them my example as explanation.

As a grad school TA I would memorize students's names as they introduced themselves on the first day, then repeat them back immediately and again at the end of class.

I memorized the entire argument of Hobbes' Leviathan using a memory palace and memorized Odysseus and Achilles's exchange in the underworld in ancient Greek.

When I learned in my first German class that prepositions take different cases, I extracted every preposition from the text and memorized their cases over a weekend. (A friend later taught me a couple of songs that he learned at the Goethe Institute that accomplished the same thing with way less effort.) With the help of a wonderfully patient professor, I memorized dozens of poems by Goethe, Rilke, Heine, and Gottfried Benn so I had an internalized pronunciation reference.


# You are a Robot, You Lack Creativity

Memorizing things seems very practical to me. In the same way that you might pack a lunch when you know you're going to need a lunch, you should just pack a few things in your head whenever you know you're going to need them later.

After university, though, I've regularly run into people who are horrified that I memorize things. These are usually engineers or scientists that I respect, so it often made me feel bad.

I would argue that people who are very experienced with concepts eventually memorize them and then work with them at a higher level of fluency, and that you can jump-start this fluency by just memorizing up front. The counterargument was often that any memorization is 'rote memorization', which is by its nature evil and anti-creative, and that people should derive any concepts from first princples as they need them. Steve Yegge says that "Having a good memory is a serious impediment to understanding. It lets you cheat your way through life." http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html.  

These criticisms used to sting, but in recent years, conversations of this sort have been followed by the critics forwarding a link to Michael Nielsen's article on memorization using Anki. I am very grateful that he wrote this, as it rebuts a lot of the arguments against memorization and makes a very persuasive case for. I also find it interesting that so many people go on to do research after this kind of discussion.


### Techniques

Like Michael, I use Anki and SRS (or flashcards generally) to memorize things. I also use many of the techniques that he fears might be less useful. I will outline how each works and link to examples or descriptions for people who want more information. Rather than go into detail about the technique itself (especially given the note below), I want to spend a little time on How to use the techniques and Why you might want to.

I won't talk about the value of Anki, or flashcards in general, or SRS <link> since Michael does that well. I want to talk about some of techniques he doesn't use, plus one that I think is peculiar to me. TODO: get link, check terminology.

Below I give a brief description of every technique I use reguarly. <strong>Be warned</strong> that literally dozens of people have asked me to explain one or more of these techniques, and exactly one ever put in the effort to learn and use them. (He passed the EMT exam!) Because these techniques are described well in many easily accessible places, I'll focus my discussion on HOW I use them.

TODO: Add link from other posts to this one
I use several of the most common techniques regularly. Rather than 
Technique, How I use it, Example
Mnemonic link; Assign nouns to the items I want to memorize, then link them together with verbs; celestial crown
Major system, Use sounds to represent string so of digits, then tie them together with mnemonic link, wikipedia
Peg system, Major system for fixed numbers provide a set of quick 'hooks' for memorizing lists, wikipedia
Memory palace, Remember items by mentally placing them in a well-known space, wikipedia
Anki, spaced repetition, flashcards; Review regularly, especially just as you're about to forget; wikipedia
drawing/painting, schematics

### How I use them
I use all of these techniques, but mnemonic link and the major system are the most flexible. Rather than go into detail about the techniques themselves, I want to explain How I apply them.

### Staple Gun
Quickly memorize something when away from notes; nail down something that I look up repeatedly (how to perform some task, for example)
peg system, mnemonic link
Fast, superficial
Quickly memorize something that I use frequently
when was descartes born/died musketeer/cyrano/three musketeers
Memorize something on the fly when I am away from my desk/notes.


### Deep Foundation
Learning something completely new; memorization provides pilings for a deep foundation -- these are both fixed points to build on and 'landmarks' for orienting yourself in future studies
just memorize some random facts and start building
mnemonic link, major system, flashcards
my own personal metaphor is of a marsh. The landscape is undifferentiated, and you don't have any firm ground, but if you hammer pilings down in the deep foundation so you have both landmarks and something to build on. You can bootstrap/chunk up more quickly if you just nail a few things down.

### Nerve splicing
connect topics (especially dry ones) to things I already know and have an interest in
find interest in a new topic
Example anthropomobi

### Miscellaneous
can do physical stuff: scavenger hunt
the other techqniques let you figure out when you're paying enough attention -- after a while, you realize how much attention you have to pay to memorize 30 names and you don't need techniques.
make little circles for people around you -- people tend to sit in the same place
make a seating grid
draw things


# Why memorize
main argument -- 'chunking is valuabe', you can get fluent faster
aesthetics -- connection with history
ranging ability -- you get experience with how much effort it takes to learn something
ultimate mindfulness

I don't think anyone finds the contrasting argument compelling, By contrast, in the Meno, Plato describes understanding as a kind of remembering (anamnesis). He touches and he touches on the idea in the Phaedrus where ...

It covers a lot of great points that I don't need to cover, including how he uses flashcards and spaced repetition through Anki, which I also love. Michael mentions some other techniques 

they seem most useful for memorizing trivia – sequences of playing cards, strings of digits, and so on. They seem less well developed for more abstract concepts, and such abstractions are often where the deepest understanding lies. In that sense, they may even distract from understanding. That said, it's possible I simply need to figure out better ways of using these ideas, much as I needed to figure out Anki. In particular, it may be worth further investigating some of the techniques used by practitioners to form rich associations. As Foer says, quoting a memory expert, there is great value in learning to “think in more memorable ways”.

By contrast, Plato tried to argue that understanding was really just remembering (anamnesis). The main argument is the geometric proof that he leads the servant to in the Meno using the maieutic method, but there is an interesting related passage in the Phaedrus 
Interestingly, Plato has Socrates make the opposite argument, that with the gift of writing lots of people can appear wise without really being so
