<h1>I Memorize Things</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

My family placed unusual demands on memory. We moved over 16 times before I started my senior year of high school, so I had to learn 16 addresses, phone numbers, groups of kids' names, and ways home. A routine part of outings was having my dad pull over and ask me how we had got there. I wasn't allowed to say 'left', or 'right', but had to describe every turn using compass bearings.<sup>1</sup>
</p><p>
My uncle was a California highway patrolman and later a marshal. He made me memorize the alphabet backwards. He was frustrated that even sober people couldn't do it. He himself used to casually memorize the license plate of every car he parked near (and as a kid I was terrified on behalf of the hypothetical bad drivers who might ding his truck and drive off thinking he couldn't find them).
</p><p>
We used to visit the jail regularly when I was a kid back in California for the summers. As a result I conceived the (I now recognize) bizarre idea that everyone eventually goes to prison. As a result, I began to notice stories of political prisoners sustaining themselves in isolation with foreign languages and poems they had memorized, and this increased my desire to furnish my brain. (The <em>Count of Monte Cristo</em> really affected me.)
</p><p>
She denies this now, but my mother paid me $22 in today's dollars to memorize the times tables through 12 x 12 overnight when I told her our math teacher said parents should help us learn them.
</p><p>
Finally, when I was 11 I found we had a book on memory techniques written by a magician. By that point, memorizing things seemed like a necessary skill, so I learned all the techniques and started to use them at school.


<h2>Applications</h2>

OK, so with that background, here are a few examples of things I memorized. I want to show what I thought of as a normal thing to do.

For every essay exam in college I would guess a handful of questions I thought might appear, find commonalities between pairs of questions so I could reduce them to themes, then write 3-5 essays (with citations) on those themes, then memorize the essays. I never had to answer an essay question I hadn't already written an essay for. When I told my mom the strategy I had come up with to guarantee A's, she said she had done exactly the same thing.

Because I misunderstood a line on our syllabus, I memorized the title, recording date, and band composition for over 150 classic jazz recordings. When my roommate took music theory from the same professor a year later, the professor said he couldn't listen to any complaints about how hard it is to remember chord resolutions and gave them my example as explanation.

As a grad school TA I would memorize students's names as they introduced themselves on the first day, then repeat them back immediately and again at the end of class.

I memorized the entire argument of Plato's Republic using a memory palace and memorized Odysseus and Achilles's exchange in the underworld in ancient Greek.

When I learned in my first German class that prepositions take different cases, I extracted every preposition from the text and memorized their cases over a weekend. (A friend later taught me a couple of songs that he learned at the Goethe Institut that accomplished the same thing with way less effort.) With the help of a wonderfully patient professor, I memorized dozens of poems by Goethe, Rilke, and Heine so I had an internalized pronunciation reference.


<h2>You are a Robot, You Lack Creativity</h2>

Growing up, memorizing things seemed practical and ordinary. In the same way that you might pack a lunch when you know you're going to need a lunch, you can just pack a few things into your head whenever you think you might need them later.

After university, though, I've regularly run into people who are philosophically opposed to memorization. These are usually engineers or scientists that I respect, so it often made me feel bad.

I argued that people who are very experienced with concepts eventually memorize them and then work with them at a higher level of fluency, and that you can jump-start this fluency by memorizing up front. The contrary position was often that any memorization is 'rote memorization', which is by its nature evil, anti-creative, and evidence of a lack of true understanding. Instead of memorizing, the counterargument continued, people should derive concepts from first principles as they need them. Steve Yegge <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html">says</a> "Having a good memory is a serious impediment to understanding. It lets you cheat your way through life." 
.
These criticisms used to sting, but in recent years, conversations of this sort have been followed by the critics' forwarding a link to Michael Nielsen's <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">article</a> on memorization with Anki. I am grateful that Michael wrote this, as it rebuts a lot of the arguments against memorization and makes a persuasive case for (it's also partly an <em>argumentum ad verecundiam</em>, which people find persuasive: "Well this smart guy says it's OK, so...".


## Techniques

Like Michael, I use Anki and SRS (and flashcards generally) to memorize things, but I also use many of the techniques that he eschews. I want to explain how I use them and why I find them a valuable complement to SRS.

Here is a list of the techniques I find useful, a brief description of how they work and what they are good for, and a link to an example. Because these techniques are readily accessible, and because literally *one person* of the dozens that have asked me to explain these techniques has taken the time to learn and use them, I won't spend a lot of time elaborating them. Instead, I will spend some time below on the depth of learning that is possible with these techniques.

I use several of the most common techniques regularly. Rather than 
Technique, How I use it, Example, Effort to learn, Depends on
Mnemonic link; Assign nouns to the items I want to memorize, then link them together with verbs; celestial crown; low
Major system, Use sounds to represent string so of digits, then tie them together with mnemonic link, wikipedia; high; makes use of mnemonic link
Peg system, Major system for fixed numbers provide a set of quick 'hooks' for memorizing lists, wikipedia; high (but ~zero if you already know the Major Sytem)
Memory palace, Remember items by mentally placing them in a well-known space, wikipedia; medium
Anki, spaced repetition, flashcards; Review regularly, especially just as you're about to forget; wikipedia; low
drawing/painting, schematics; high/idiosyncratic

## How I use them
I use all of these techniques (including Anki and spaced repetition as noted above), but I find Mnemonic Link and the Major System the most routinely useful. I've included links and examples above so you can learn how to use them. Rather than review the techniques proper, I want to explain How I apply them, and some non-obvious ways they are useful. I think this may motivate more people to learn these skills to enhance their minds.


### Staple Gun
I'm afraid the first example of how I use these techniques vindicates the critics -- I really do use them for memorizing arbitrary trivia! But I'll explain why I think this is a useful skill to have. If you are the kind of person who will write a script to automate a recurring task, the Staple Gun approach to memorization is the equivalent. Of course you can look up a fact or the steps of a process whenever you need to, but with training, you can pin things in memory in less time than it takes to look them up twice.

Here's an example: in college, my edition of Meditations on First Philosophy had a portrait of the author on the cover that made him look like a musketeer. Every time I saw it, I wondered why, but it was never important enough to pursue (and hard to google: "Why does Descartes dress like a musketeer?"). Finally, I looked up and memorized a few dates:

Ren√© Descartes: 1596-1650
Cyrano de Bergerac set in: 1640
The Three Musketeers set in: 1625-1628

Apparently lots of people dressed like musketeers when Descartes was alive.

This is exactly the kind of rote memorization that people object to, but once you know the Major System, it takes less time to memorize something than to look it up again. Of course that's not a good reason to memorize things! I could look these dates up each time I identify a new potential overlap, but it's convenient to have them available on demand. There is a side benefit that the more dates you have welded into your brain (especially about things you are actually curious about), the easier it is to place new things in historical context.


### Deep Foundation
One of the 16 moves our family made was to Florida, where we lived first on the Kissimmee River in the swampy interior, then later on a sailboat on Anna Maria Island. Every morning I would jump overboard and swim under the barnacle-covered pilings that held up the dock that connected us to the island.

A new domain can sometimes seem like a big, undifferentiated expanse of water or swamp. Memorizing does two things -- it lets me drop pilings down into a firm foundation so I have something to build on; it also creates landmarks that help me orient myself as I'm building my edifice of knowledge.

Eventually you want to learn the abstract concepts 

This is the Deep Foundation approach to learning things. Sometimes I even memorize arbitrary facts within the topic -- even without context, these become a foundation on which to build other knowledge. A recent example is from a book club at work where we were reading Jurafsky's NLP book. Or in college, memorizing the entire argument of a longish book like Leviathan or The Republic. Having the whole structure in your head makes it easier to focus on arguments, counterarguments and context. Either just a few small facts that you build on, to the entire edifice that you can then inhabit.

Different from staple gun because you are learning or creating context, too. A common metaphor for learning is building an 'edifice of knowledge' -- memorizing can let you build the foundation quickly.

Techniques: All are useful, but Memory palace and flaschards are particularly appropriate

### Splicing
Make them vibrate with interests you already have
The last major approach is the most involved. Often the subject is more constrained than a whole discipline. Maybe it's a programming technique or a specific concept.

In learning it is easy to think you understand something when it is explained. It's much harder to use it or apply it. This is especially true in math or philosophy. You need facility with the concept -- practice using it, not just exposure to it.

I think of this as 'splicing', because you are grafting a new concept onto old ones. Just as when you are memorizing a long mnemonic chain, you want the first link to represent everything you are trying to remember. In the same way, you can use splicing to connect existing impulses to the new concepts you are trying to assimilate.

This is especially effective if the topic is somewhat dry. If you can connect it to things you already know, or especially to existing interests, you can animate a topic for yourself, connect it to existing interests, then let your natural curiosity deepen your relationship to it.

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
All the techniques above are ways of tricking your visual or spatial apparatus into remembering things. Here are some non-mnemonic practices to help you "think in more memorable ways":

1. Draw
It is hard to forget the details of something you have taken the time to draw. In addition, you  think that if you pay enough attention to something to draw it, you at least a little bit come to love it too. I started drawing pigeons, and came to notice so much variety I had not noticed before, and conceived tremendous affection for these fans of ours, so full of hope.

I find that when I take the time to draw something, it also colors my emotions. I 

Other benefits of drawing -- you start seeing things differently, ...

I think most people acknowledge that drawing has many benefits, but they resist because they are not 'good'.
Many people resist drawing because they are not 'good'. You don't have to be 'good', you don't even have to show anybody what you draw. The best part of drawing has little to do with showing the result to others.
Each imprefection lets you notice 

Finally, a pitfall: I know from experience that it's easy to become an "art supply collector," but you can get all the benefit of art with a ball-point pen and a folded sheet of printer paper. I am much more likely to do artistic things when I have tools and paper that are themselves aesthetically pleasing, but I think I would have learned more if I took al lthe time I spent trying out different brushes, pencils, etc.a nd Start simple

1. Write
Writing a story about something will help you remember it, especially if you notice and record all the details that are usually left out: emotions, smells, ...


1. Narrate
If drawing or writing are intimidating, narrate. Say how tall someone is, what color shirt they are wearing, what color eyes they have. There's both a creative element and an observing element. The creative part is "What would be itnteresting to record?" It requires certain kind of attention. And then actually recording it requires another kind of attention. Will you record colors, counts of people, actions, eye color, motivations, back story?

1. Cast spells -- physical activity; e.g., periodic table exercise plan
By this I mean perform some unusual physical activity. Ceremonies are spells in this sense -- rituals that make something memorable. If after completing all your college coursework you just automatically got your diploma as an email attachment, it would be much less memorable than dressing up in an unusual outfit and enacting a ritual and listending to a speech with a bunch of people you care about. You can create your own rituals and spells and make things memorable.

1. Make maps -- learn people by location, inverse of memory palace
The story of the origin of memory palace is collapse.
Seating chart -- little circles in your notebook or excel if it's a permanent seating arrangement (say in the office). When new people join, I print out a seating cheat sheet so they can check names without feeling embarrassed.

Ironically, the thing that most people would like to remember is people. But it's so common to hear people say, "I'll never remember all these names."



Pressurizer -- concentrate focus to reduce time (like a reverse lever)
One of the biggest benefits is that you learn the feeling of paying *enough* attention to something, and you invoke that effort when you need it.

the other techqniques let you figure out when you're paying enough attention -- after a while, you realize how much attention you have to pay to memorize 30 names and you don't need techniques.
make little circles for people around you -- people tend to sit in the same place
draw things

The most important reason is chunking, but an important second in another domain is being able to 'range' your ability. My feeling when I memorize something is not that I am using a 'trick' and somehow doing less work than another person who memorize through frequent exposure. It is more that I am using leverage or perhaps better pressure to increase throughput. I'm doing the same amount of work, just more effectively and so more intensely. One side effect is that I have a sense of how much effort is required to do the work.

One of the poems I memorized is Der Panther. It's depressing, but contains a number of evocative images, and 'sounds' like the thing it is describing. One line is: 'nur manchmal schiebt der forhang der Pupille/sich lautlos auf, dan geht ein Bild hinein'. In the poem the image dies, but this poem has colored my view of memorization. I think of it as lifting a stone door guarding a cave to let in light. It takes intense effort and you can't hold it open very long, but when you do it, you can 'see' something intensely and unforgettably.

I don't use any kind of techniques for meeeting pepole now, instead, I try to lift the cave door. I try to make this effort now in learning names. I try to really pay attention when meeting someone now and try to sear it in my brain the first time. Of course it's not perfect, so I will repeat the name every time I see the person to make sure I've got it. But the practice makes me stronger at door lifts, and I enjoy the effort. It's the ultimate mindfulness practice.


## Why Memorize

As noted:
Chunking/abstraction, increased fluency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunk</a>
Speed/efficiency: compress learning, avoid repetition, skip to the good part
Remove annoyances -- In the same way you might automate a recurring chore..., another kind of automation
Self-reliance -- both generally, and specifically if you don't have a pen or phone, or if you for example suddenly need to memorize the license plate of a speeding car


Here are some more unusual reasons to memorize:

wake up/Scoping": Really understand how much attention is required to lift the ...how much you should be paying attention
residual effect -- once you train yourself, you pick up things without realizing it, you will get a background process that pays attention to things
social benefits; good for shy people -- the 'game' of learning everyone's name is more powerful than; not a goal of mine, but I've seen over and over that if you can remember 30 people's names in a few minutes, all 30 of them will remember yours.

Many of these reasons are instrumental All of these re
The best reason, I think absorb things that you love and want to have with you always. The more you wake up to something, the more affection you can develop for it.:w
The unrobbable bank; it happened and I remember
make it a permanent part of you, assimilate it, have it with you always

Funes the memorious -- the opposite!

[Funes] remembered the shapes of the clouds in the south at dawn on the 30th of April of 1882, and he could compare them in his recollection with the marbled grain in the design of a leather-bound book which he had seen only once, and with the lines in the spray which an oar raised in the Rio Negro on the eve of the battle of the Quebracho. These recollections were not simple; each visual image was linked to muscular sensations, thermal sensations, etc. He could reconstruct all his dreams, all his fancies. Two or three times he had reconstructed an entire day.

========================================
1. This really helped me once. My first day on the job as a blacksmith's apprentice in W√ºrzburg, Germany, the foreman asked if I could drive one of the pickups back to the warehouse. At the first intersection, he forgot I was following him and sped through a red light. I was a foreigner with no cell phone, no driver's license, no work permit, a truck I couldn't account for, and a limited vocabulary, but before I could worry about it too much, I realized I actually knew the way back. Thanks, Dad!<sup>[return]</sup>
