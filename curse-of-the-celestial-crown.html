<h2>The Case</h2>

You, a private investigator and adventurer, have been hired to recover the Chinese zodiac, whose signs have fallen from the night sky. Your client is the Rat King, boss of the local underworld. You rendezvous with him in the Manhattan subway tunnels, where he has his lair.
</p><p>
When you arrive, the Rat King is sitting on his throne. You notice that he is holding a barbecue fork, with which he is tending something roasting on a spit. At his elbow is a large goblet of wine. You also notice that he is wearing a crown. On the crown glow twelve constellations.
</p><p>
"Yes, OK, I did it," the Rat King says, with a dismissive wave of the fork. "I stole the constellations and set them in this crown. It's dark down here and I needed something to improve the atmosphere."
</p><p>
"You're not here to investigate anything. The magic I used to capture the constellations invoked a curse that must be expiated."
</p><p>
Rat minions lead out an ox on a tether. One of them hands you a large sword. "Perform the ritual sacrifice," the Rat King orders. You raise the sword and cut the tether, then slap the ox with the flat of the sword so that it bolts and escapes.
</p><p>
Enraged, the Rat King throws his goblet of wine at you. "You'll regret this in the end!" he chitters.
</p><p>
The wine splatters in the dust, forming stripes that coalesce into a tiger that rises from the earth and turns on you with a roar. Fortunately, your parents taught you how to control a tiger -- you leap and catch him by his toe. The toe comes off in your grip with a pop! and the tiger deflates, propelling him across the room like a balloon rocket, trailing alcoholic exhaust.
</p><p>
The white toe in your hand makes a little hop and starts to grow. Small white ears appear and grow longer. You notice a smell of mint as the fuzzy white object transforms into a rabbit's foot and then grows into a small rabbit. For a moment, you feel very lucky.
</p><p>
But the transformation continues. The ears turn black and crack, and leather wings push out. The cracks shatter completely and an enormous black dragon rears up from the remains, eyes glowing, mouth wide. Down its gullet you see a roaring flame.
</p><p>
You raise your sword and hack at the beast. Your luck guides your blows and you manage to slice off all four limbs and both wings.
</p><p>
You now face a snake, which presses its attack. You judge that it is time to make your escape. You leap onto your horse and ride for the tunnel exit, but at the last minute the snake strikes your horse's heel.
</p><p>
The horse stumbles, but carries you away. It grows feeble, shrinks, becomes skittish and frail, until your feet are dragging the ground you and realize that the snake's poison has transformed your horse into a goat. 
</p><p>
You dismount at the edge of a forest. The goat bleats. A mass of trees detaches itself from the forest, looming high above the highest tree. You recognize a giant monkey as it raises a massive fist. You dodge out of the way as the monkey pancakes the bleating goat.
</p><p>
The monkey raises its fist again, searching for you. In that instant, the sun rises and a rooster crows, turning the monkey to stone.
</p><p>
You sit down, relieved. The rooster continues to crow and your relief gradually turns to annoyance. Eventually, you pick up a rock and throw it at the rooster to shut it up.
</p><p>
Back along the trajectory of the stone bounds a dog, who drops at your feet not the stone you threw, nor a ball, but a <em>pearl</em>, cast before swine as you slowly transform into a pig.
</p><p>
The Rat King reaches out from the beginning of this story to skewer you with his barbecue fork and set you on his spit to roast.
</p><p>
"I told you you would regret it in the end," he whispers.

<h2>Notes</h2>
If you read the story above and try to <em>see</em> all the connections in it, you should be able to memorize the elements and order of the Chinese zodiac in a few minutes.
<p>
When we were studying in Shanghai, a friend and I decided to take a train to Harbin to get some experience with the high-status Mandarin accent. We had recently visited friends in Hong Kong, and we observed on the train that the <em>loon</em> in Kowloon and the <em>long</em> Heilongjiang (the province we were headed to), are the same character, 'dragon'. So Kowloon means 'Nine Dragons' and Heilongjiang means 'Black Dragon River'.
</p><p>
To pass the time, we tried to recall the Chinese zodiac, partly to see if there were any other useful words in it that we had overlooked. Dragon is rare in English outside of fantasy novels, but it is pretty common in China (and elsewhere in Asia, too -- when I lived in Japan, I met a lot of Ryu's, and honestly am a little jealous that Dragon is not a more common name in the US).
</p><p>
Once we pieced the zodiac together, the story above is what I came up with to fix the order in memory. 2020 is the first year of the rat to occur since that trip, so I thought I would record it here. 
</p><p>
The first item in the list is the crown -- I've learned from experience that you want a 'hook' to represent the whole set of things you are memorizing. As with a singly linked list, the memorization technique works in one direction, so the first item works like a reference to the root node to get things started. The first zodiac character is the Rat, so he gets the crown to start things off, and interacts with the pig at the end to complete the cycle.
</p><p>
It's easy in the case of a zodiac, but it's best to choose nouns to represent the things that you are memorizing.
</p><p>
As in the examples above, violent, gross, lewd, surprising, sad or disappointing connections tend to be more memorable than others, though very conventional or cliched connections can make something easy to remember too, like "catch a tiger by the toe" and "pearls before swine" here. (I think many movie titles use awkward puns to leverage this effect.)
</p><p>
It's also effective to include all your senses. Don't forget smell and sound.
</p><p>
Don't worry, the connections are just a kind of scaffolding. They eventually fall away and you 'just know' the things you were memorizing. So don't be afraid to be extreme when making connections. You don't have to tell anyone what they are.
